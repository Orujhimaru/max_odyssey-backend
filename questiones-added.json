    "question": "Based on the texts, Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?",
    "passage": "Text 1: Microbes are tiny organisms in the soil, water, and air all around us. They thrive even in very harsh conditions. That\u2019s why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn\u2019t seem to contain any life. The finding doesn\u2019t prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes\u2019 survival. Text 2: Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it\u2019s unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer\u2019s team\u2019s study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures.",
      "B) A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site.",
      "C) Microbes are likely difficult to detect in the soil at the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere.",
      "D) Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer\u2019s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer\u2019s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn\u2019t appear to contain any life. Fierer\u2019s team says that though this doesn\u2019t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it\u2019s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer\u2019s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer\u2019s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer\u2019s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn\u2019t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn\u2019t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer\u2019s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them, but the author doesn\u2019t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer\u2019s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples.",

Studying wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres, the team reported that traces of elements such as lithium and sodium support the presence of exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth\u2019s. Text 2: Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have concluded that certain exoplanets had continental crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signifiers of the types of rock found on Earth. The studies don\u2019t adequately account for different minerals made up of various ratios of those elements, and the possibility of rock types not found on Earth that contain those minerals.",

Therefore, Putirka and Xu would likely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium are also found in rocks that are not like Earth\u2019s continental crust. Choice A is incorrect because the texts do not indicate how widely held any of the viewpoints described are.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because neither text discusses how new this area of study is.

    "passage": "Text 1: In a study of the benefits of having free time, Marissa Sharif found that the reported sense of life satisfaction tended to plateau when participants had two hours of free time per day and actually began to fall when they had five hours of free time per day. After further research, Sharif concluded that this dip in life satisfaction mainly occurred when individuals spent all their free time unproductively, such as by watching TV or playing games. Text 2: Psychologist James Maddux cautions against suggesting an ideal amount of free time. The human desire for both free time and productivity is universal, but Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction. Furthermore, he points out that there is no objective definition for what constitutes productivity; reading a book might be considered a productive activity by some, but idleness by others.",

      "D) By claiming that the specific activities named in Text 1 are actually examples of productive activities rather than unproductive ones"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it characterizes how Maddux would most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif reached after her research. Text 1 describes Sharif\u2019s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. \u00a0However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively\u2014that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others.",

    "passage": "Text 1: The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event is usually attributed solely to an asteroid impact near Chicxulub, Mexico. Some scientists argue that ==volcanic activity was the true cause, as the K-Pg event occurred relatively early in a long period of eruption of the Deccan Traps range that initially produced huge amounts of climate-altering gases.== These dissenters note that other mass extinctions have coincided with large volcanic eruptions, while only the K-Pg event lines up with an asteroid strike. Text 2: In a 2020 study, Pincelli Hull and her colleagues analyzed ocean core samples and modeled climate changes around the K-Pg event. The team concluded that Deccan Traps gases did affect global conditions prior to the event, but that the climate returned to normal well before the extinctions began\u2014extinctions that instead closely align with the Chicxulub impact.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes how Hull\u2019s team would most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1, which asserts that volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps range led to changes in the climate and caused the K-Pg mass extinction event. According to Text 2, although Hull\u2019s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the climate before the K-Pg event, the team determined that the climate had returned to normal before mass extinctions began. This finding and the observation that the K-Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub asteroid impact suggest that Hull\u2019s team would likely dispute the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 and say that the climate changes caused by the Deccan Traps activity were not the main cause of the extinctions. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull\u2019s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull\u2019s team would disagree that the Deccan Traps activity caused the K-Pg event. Additionally, the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 says nothing about how the Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull\u2019s team might believe that the impact did in fact change the climate, they could not be said to agree with the claim in Text 1 on this point.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication in either text that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity, so there is no reason to conclude that Hull\u2019s team would question why the scientists referred to in Text 1 make such an assumption.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull\u2019s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull\u2019s team would say that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring effect on global conditions than the scientists referenced in Text 1 believe, not that the effect on global conditions was more significant than those scientists claim.",

An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration. Text 2: When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Text 1 based on the information provided.

Text 1 characterizes this discovery as \u201cespecially promising\u201d and a sign of \u201cexciting progress\u201d in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR\u2019s function in humans isn\u2019t yet known, it\u2019s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1\u2019s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava\u2019s team\u2019s observations about EGR in humans. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven\u2019t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn\u2019t say that Text 1\u2019s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1\u2019s excitement as premature and overly optimistic.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people.

Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues\u2019 evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey\u2019s evidence is. Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from \u201c1321\u20131407 CE\u2014over a century before Europeans invaded the region\u201d and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey\u2019s account in Text 1.

Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens.

Text 1 focuses on the discovery of a strange fossil consisting of the skull of the extinct species Oculudentavis khaungraae. According to Text 1, the fossil has features that appear to be avian, or related to birds, which led researchers to initially think that the fossil might be a very small avian dinosaur. Text 2 begins by noting the discovery of a second fossil similar to the one discussed in Text 1, then explains that based on detailed studies of both fossils, paleontologists think that the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls appeared avian at first. This suggests that the paleontologists in Text 2 recognize that the fossils do indeed look like they could be related to birds. For this reason, the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1\u2014that the fossil was avian\u2014is understandable, even if the fossil is probably not avian but rather is from a lizard. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the fossils initially looked avian, so the paleontologists described in Text 2 wouldn\u2019t be confused by the researchers in Text 1 initially thinking that O. khaungraae might be related to birds. The paleontologists would find that initial thought understandable, not confusing. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 never mentions lizards, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense for the paleontologists in Text 2 to say that the researchers in Text 1 mistakenly assumed that O. khaungraae must be a lizard. Choice D is incorrect. Although the paleontologists in Text 2 might agree that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1 was reasonable, nothing in Text 2 suggests that the two skulls were shaped differently.",

According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues\u2019 perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.

Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn\u2019t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it.

In arguing that graphic novels shouldn\u2019t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"\u2014that is, comparatively very little\u2014in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn\u2019t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel\u2019s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes. Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn\u2019t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there\u2019s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn\u2019t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn\u2019t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn\u2019t imply that graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written\u2014that is, well crafted\u2014as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn\u2019t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted.",

Knowing that cost reductions would expand access to mycoprotein, biochemists are exploring solutions, such as a cheaper substrate to feed the mycoprotein as it grows. Text 2: Cattle farming is a principal cause of global deforestation, and a study by Florian Humpen\u00f6der and his colleagues found that replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of mycoprotein would cut deforestation by half if accomplished over the next thirty years.

The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpen\u00f6der and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people\u2019s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people\u2019s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue.

The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo\u2019s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn\u2019t the only thing that influences flamingos\u2019 coloring. Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn\u2019t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo\u2019s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos\u2019 feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn\u2019t notice a change wouldn\u2019t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo\u2019s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos\u2019 shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn\u2019t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.",

Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old\u2014much older than the Clovis people\u2019s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces\u2014that they are human-made tools\u2014that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence. Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn\u2019t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group\u2019s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn\u2019t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group\u2019s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent\u2019s first inhabitants. Therefore, there\u2019s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.",

    "passage": "Text 1: In 1954 George Balanchine choreographed a production of *The Nutcracker*, a ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage *The Nutcracker* each year. ==But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced.== Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences. Text 2: *The Nutcracker* is outdated, but it should be kept because it\u2019s a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show *Hot Chocolate Nutcracker* combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009.",
    "choices": [
      "A) By questioning the idea that the story of The Nutcracker is stuck in the past and by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version",
      "B) By agreeing that contemporary audiences have largely stopped going to see performances of The Nutcracker because it\u2019s so old-fashioned",
      "C) By pointing out that most dance companies could increase their incomes by offering modernized versions of The Nutcracker",
      "D) By suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by noting the success of The Nutcracker but then claims that the ballet is \"stuck in the past\" and should \"no longer be produced.\" Text 2 begins by conceding that The Nutcracker is indeed outdated but argues that it should continue to be performed, states that the show can be updated to include more contemporary dance styles, and provides an example of one such modernized version, Hot Chocolate Nutcracker. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 advocates for using creative ways to update The Nutcracker and therefore wouldn\u2019t respond to the underlined claim by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version. Choice B is incorrect because although the authors of both texts claim that The Nutcracker is outdated, neither text suggests that contemporary audiences have largely stopped attending productions of the show. On the contrary, Text 2 states that The Nutcracker is a holiday favorite and generates substantial income for some dance companies. Choice C is incorrect because although Text 2 provides an example of a contemporized version of The Nutcracker, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that offering modernized versions is a way to increase income for most dance companies. Rather, the author of Text 2 suggests that offering modernized versions is a way to make the ballet discussed in Text 1 feel less outdated.",

Generally, while characters in computer-animated films appear highly exaggerated, environments and lighting are carefully engineered to mimic reality. But some animators, such as Pixar\u2019s Sanjay Patel, are focused on a different question.

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, \u201cHow lifelike are they?\u201d The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren\u2019t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film\u2019s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films\u2019 unique stories and aren\u2019t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience\u2019s reactions to characters in animated films.",

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren\u2019t certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don\u2019t have enough information about the star\u2019s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse\u2019s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn\u2019t be sufficient.

    "passage": "The following text is from Edith Wharton\u2019s 1905 novel *The House of Mirth*. Lily Bart and a companion are walking through a park. Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the fitting background of her own sensations. ==The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches.== On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there the lingering green of an oak-grove.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be \u201ckeenly sensitive to\u201d scenes that serve as a \u201cfitting background\u201d for her feelings\u2014that is, she\u2019s very aware of when a setting seems to reflect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she\u2019s in as a large-scale reflection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It\u2019s the next sentence that adds specific details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conflict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reflects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reflect her current mood, and that assertion isn\u2019t expanded on in the next sentence. Instead, the next sentence describes specific details of the scene without connecting them to Lily\u2019s feelings.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish that birds of some species don\u2019t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specifically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out finding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise. Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specific behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence\u2019s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn\u2019t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds\u2019 nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it\u2019s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds\u2019 reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they\u2019ve hatched.",

The underlined sentence then describes the data the team consulted and how they were used (comparing predictions about earnings to what the companies actually earned), and the final sentence presents what the team found in their examination of the data. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to explain part of the methodology used in the team\u2019s study. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence explains in part how the team conducted their analysis of the effect of sunshine but doesn\u2019t address what the team found; a broad summary is instead given in the other two sentences.

      "D) To consider how Indigenous politicians in the United States have influenced Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to illustrate two approaches that Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve political representation for their communities. The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplified by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for office who support causes that are important to their communities. Choice A is incorrect because the text\u2019s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn\u2019t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have influenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians\u2019 approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city\u2019s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco\u2019s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn\u2019t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals\u2014or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as \u201ca living showcase of San Francisco\u2019s artistic spirit,\u201d the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.",

    "passage": "For his 1986 album *Keyboard Fantasies*, Beverly Glenn-Copeland wrote songs grounded in traditional soul and folk music, then accompanied them with futuristic synthesizer arrangements featuring ambient sounds and complex rhythms.

The underlined portion of the text mentions two of those musicians, Blood Orange and Moses Sumney, who \u201ccite the album as an influence.\u201d Therefore, the underlined portion of the text offers examples of younger musicians whose work has been impacted by Keyboard Fantasies. Choice A is incorrect because even though the underlined sentence states that Blood Orange and Moses Sumney were influenced by Keyboard Fantasies, it doesn\u2019t say that all other musicians should also embrace the album\u2019s experimental style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Keyboard Fantasies was not admired on its first release, the text doesn\u2019t present any criticism of the album by younger musicians: it only presents two younger musicians who cite it as an influence.

    "passage": "The following text is adapted from *Indian Boyhood*, a 1902 memoir by Ohiyesa (Charles A. Eastman), a Santee Dakota writer. In the text, Ohiyesa recalls how the women in his tribe harvested maple syrup during his childhood. Now the women began to test the trees\u2014moving leisurely among them, axe in hand, and striking a single quick blow, to see if the sap would appear. ==The trees, like people, have their individual characters; some were ready to yield up their life-blood, while others were more reluctant.== Now one of the birchen basins was set under each tree, and a hardwood chip driven deep into the cut which the axe had made.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text\u2019s overall portrayal of how the women in Ohiyesa\u2019s tribe harvested maple syrup. The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple trees in order to find out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap described as the trees\u2019 \u201clife-blood.\u201d Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so. Using personification, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees\u2014their potential to give sap\u2014that the women are evaluating. Choice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence does mention \u201cindividual characters,\u201d this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees, which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence focuses on the trees\u2019 willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the beneficial relationship between the women and the trees. Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benefit from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benefit from this relationship in turn. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence is comparing maple trees to humans, not addressing the influence of the natural environment on how the actual humans in the text, the women, behave.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text presents the speaker\u2019s experience of viewing the sea. In the underlined portion, the speaker focuses on the idea that the waves hitting rocks on the shore are a relentless and enduring force: they are constantly pushed back (\u201cever repulsed\u201d) but always return (\u201cever rushing on\u201d), as though they have an energy that can\u2019t be overcome (\u201ca life that will not know defeat\u201d). Choice A is incorrect. Although the underlined portion characterizes the waves as a relentless force (always \u201crepulsed\u201d but still \u201crushing on\u201d and never being defeated), the speaker doesn\u2019t suggest that the surroundings are intimidating.

Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t suggest that the speaker is ambivalent, or has mixed feelings about, the natural world. Instead, it presents a single view of one part of the immediate surroundings: the speaker characterizes the sea\u2019s waves as an unstoppable force, since they are constantly pushed back but always return (\u201cever repulsed, yet ever rushing on\u201d).\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although the text later suggests the speaker\u2019s view of her own thoughts by referring to a \u201cclouded brain\u201d and a heart that leaps joyously, this reference neither occurs within the underlined portion nor establishes a clear contrast with the relentless determination of the waves.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain different ways in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius\u2019s helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood\u2019s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text\u2019s many examples of Julius\u2019s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t portray either the narrator\u2019s or his wife\u2019s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn\u2019t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together. In fact, it\u2019s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and fish\u2014a detail that supports the text\u2019s main purpose by conveying Julius\u2019s usefulness.",

    "passage": "When ancient oak planks were unearthed during subway construction in Rome, Mauro Bernabei and his team examined the growth rings in the wood to determine where these planks came from. By comparing the growth rings on the planks to records of similar rings in oaks from Europe, the team could trace the wood to the Jura region of France, hundreds of kilometers from Rome. ==Because timber could only have been transported from distant Jura to Rome by boat, the team\u2019s findings suggest the complexity of Roman trade routes.==",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied growth rings to obtain information about the ancient oak planks found during a construction project in Rome. The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France\u2019s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the findings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a difficult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to present a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team\u2019s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks were used in the construction of a boat, nor does the underlined sentence question that conclusion. Instead, the text states that the wood could only have been transported from Jura to Rome in a boat. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply offers a conclusion drawn from the team\u2019s findings about the likely place of origin of the ancient planks; the text never mentions why oak was chosen for the planks instead of other wood. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole addresses any methods that Romans used in constructing subways.

The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is \u201caeolian transport.\u201d The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn\u2019t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered difficulties in their study.

The first sentence presents the general claim that industrial activity is not always a threat to wildlife. The underlined portion of the sentence that follows suggests that the silver-studded blue butterfly is an example of wildlife thriving in areas of industrial activity: active limestone quarries. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to introduce a specific example in support of the general claim in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect. Although the first sentence indicates that \u201cindustrial activity is often assumed\u201d to harm wildlife, in the case of the silver-studded blue butterfly the text mentions neither an assumption about this species nor any challenge to such an assumption. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only one study: the \u201csurvey.\u201d Additional studies are not mentioned in the text. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor any other portion of the text provides a definition for any of the terms used in the text\u2019s argument.",

    "passage": "The following text is from Lucy Maud Montgomery\u2019s 1908 novel *Anne of Green Gables*. Anne, an eleven-year-old girl, has come to live on a farm with a woman named Marilla in Nova Scotia, Canada. Anne reveled in the world of color about her. \u201cOh, Marilla,\u201d she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, \u201cI\u2019m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn\u2019t it? Look at these maple branches. Don\u2019t they give you a thrill\u2014several thrills? I\u2019m going to decorate my room with them.\u201d \u201cMessy things,\u201d said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed. \u201cYou clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.\u201d",
    "choices": [
      "A) To demonstrate that Anne has a newly developed appreciation of nature",
      "B) To describe an argument that Anne and Marilla often have",
      "C) To emphasize Marilla\u2019s disapproval of how Anne has decorated her room",
      "D) To show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by noting that Anne \u201creveled in the world of color about her\u201d\u2014that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped \u201caesthetic sense,\u201d or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as \u201cmessy things\u201d and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne\u2019s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn\u2019t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla\u2019s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne\u2019s personality.",

Atlante and Rinaldo are neighbors who have been secretly exchanging letters through Charlot, Atlante\u2019s sister. [Atlante] gave this letter to Charlot; who immediately ran into the balcony with it, where she still found Rinaldo in a melancholy posture, leaning his head on his hand: She showed him the letter, but was afraid to toss it to him, for fear it might fall to the ground; so he ran and fetched a long cane, which he cleft at one end, and held it while she put the letter into the cleft, and stayed not to hear what he said to it.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is\u00a0the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The narrator begins by explaining how Charlot carefully delivers Atlante\u2019s letter to Rinaldo, and then relates that Rinaldo feels \u201ctransported with joy\u201d after reading the letter. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character\u2019s happiness after reading the letter. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there\u2019s no explanation why another character hasn\u2019t written one. In addition, the text\u2019s description of Rinaldo \u201cin a melancholy posture\u201d suggests that he\u2019s sad and thoughtful, not that he\u2019s desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Charlot won\u2019t toss the letter to Rinaldo because she doesn\u2019t want it to fall, the text doesn\u2019t refer to the contents of the letter. Instead, the text describes how happy Rinaldo feels after reading it.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t make any reference to the sun or sunrise; instead, it focuses on presenting a single image of night as a person with certain clothing and features.

The text begins by stating that the new picture \u201cfailed to fit in\u201d with the other items that the shop owner has.

Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there\u2019s no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any other items.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to discuss how Derksen\u2019s compositions incorporate elements from both Indigenous and classical music. After introducing Derksen, the text describes how the songs Derksen composed for her album Orchestral Powwow feature aspects of the two musical traditions. Specifically, the text notes that Derksen wrote songs in the style of traditional powwow music but accompanied them with classical arrangements played by an orchestra that followed the beat of a powwow drum rather than the directions of a conductor. In this way, Derksen\u2019s compositions blend different cultures. Choice B is incorrect because although the text suggests that Derksen\u2019s songs contain innovative elements since they blend styles from two different musical traditions, it doesn\u2019t discuss whether her compositions constitute a new style of music, let alone whether Derksen should be recognized for creating a new style of music.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention any difficulties Derksen encountered when producing her album.

The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplified by the text\u2019s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted.

The first sentence of the text indicates that Johnson returned to the US in 1938 at which time his painting style suddenly changed. The second sentence is underlined and gives more detail about this stylistic change, noting that his earlier work consisted largely of landscapes in an expressionist style and his new works were highly stylized portraits of Black Americans. In other words, the function of the underlined sentence is to elaborate on a transitional moment in Johnson\u2019s painting career. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does mention that Johnson spent a decade in Europe, it does not discuss what other travel Johnson might have done. Furthermore, although the text mentions African, American, and Scandinavian artistic elements in Johnson\u2019s work, it does not indicate that he traveled to different locations to learn about these practices. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not focus on Johnson\u2019s personal life nor does it address how successful his career was in general. Choice D is incorrect because, rather than call it into question, the underlined sentence continues the discussion of Johnson\u2019s career by adding further relevant detail of Johnson\u2019s artistic transformation.",

He hired himself out for three months; at the end of that time to receive for his wages two hundred acres of land lying in New Hampshire. [...] His employer proving false to the contract in the matter of the land, and there being no law in the country to force him to fulfil it, Israel\u2014who, however brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch, seems nevertheless to have evinced, throughout many parts of his career, a singular patience and mildness\u2014was obliged to look round for other means of livelihood than clearing out a farm for himself in the wilderness.",

      "D) It explains why, when the situation requires it, Israel is able to undertake courageous acts that others would generally avoid."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months\u2019 work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer\u2019s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm. Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel\u2019s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel\u2019s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text\u2014that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues\u2019 hypothesis regarding this question\u2014which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer\u2014and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team\u2019s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team\u2019s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn\u2019t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team\u2019s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn\u2019t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn\u2019t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo\u2019s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo\u2019s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.",

The remainder of the text explains that the researchers hope their work in Atacama will support inquiry into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined portion functions mainly to indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert. Choice A is incorrect because to contrast two things means to show the differences between them, and the phrase \"closely mirrors\" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extreme environment in the Atacama Desert is similar to, not different from, that on Mars.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that there were many Spanish-language newspapers in cities across Texas in the late 1800s, citing San Antonio as a city that produced eleven such newspapers. The text then goes on to note that in El Paso, there were twenty-two newspapers published in Spanish in the late 1800s, more than any other Texas city. The text then concludes by explaining that the reason for this large number of Spanish-language newspapers was likely El Paso\u2019s location near Mexico and its large population of Spanish speakers. Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to explain that Spanish-language newspapers thrived in Texas cities, especially in El Paso, in the late 1800s. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas today, let alone compare them with newspapers that were published in the 1800s. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes El Paso as a particularly rich site for Spanish-language journalism in the late 1800s, the text doesn\u2019t discuss whether newspapers published in El Paso influenced the newspapers published in other cities across Texas, including San Antonio. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention whether Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas were also widely read in Mexico. The text only focuses on the popularity of Spanish-language newspapers within Texas, and especially in El Paso.",

The text begins by noting that researchers have long believed that woolly mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points. The text then describes an experiment conducted by an anthropologist to test this hypothesis. According to the text, the results of the experiment led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters using spears with Clovis points likely weren\u2019t the primary cause of the extinction. The anthropologist\u2019s results cast doubt on the long-held hypothesis presented at the beginning of the text and suggest that woolly mammoths may have become extinct in North America due to some other cause. Choice A is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that researchers have been involved in an ongoing debate. On the contrary, the text suggests that most researchers agree on the cause of the woolly mammoth\u2019s extinction in North America. Choice B is incorrect because the text never mentions any advantages or disadvantages of the method used in the experiment, focusing instead on the results achieved using that method. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only one hypothesis, that mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by introducing the natural phenomenon of intermittent mass loss with regard to Asteroid 6478 Gault and notes that it curiously has not lost mass at its perihelion like other asteroids typically do. The text then refutes \"solar energy\u2013driven ice vaporization\" and \"the singular nature of impact ejection\" as two possible explanations for Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss. Finally, the text presents Luu et al.\u2019s explanation that \"6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability,\" which the author says is \"likely correct.\" Thus, the overall structure of the text is that it introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then presents a third explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t distinguish between multiple observations. It focuses on the single observation that Asteroid 6478 Gault is losing mass and evaluates multiple explanations for the phenomenon. The text also asserts that Luu et al.\u2019s explanation is credible and \"likely correct.\" Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a natural phenomenon, not a specific astronomical finding. In addition, although the text does note flawed reasons for Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss, it doesn\u2019t mention that Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss is based on new evidence. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does evaluate explanations for the cause of Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss, the text also asserts that Luu et al.\u2019s explanation that they have put forth is persuasive and \"likely correct.\"",

The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant figures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement\u2019s participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement\u2019s participants.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega\u2019s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn\u2019t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe\u2014nor does any portion of the text.

Although the narrator mentions that she had to learn the home telephone number before her mother would give her permission to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about memorizing the telephone number. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to navigation tasks like finding a route to a store only through backyards, the text contains no specific directions to any store, nor is any store identified as the narrator\u2019s favorite. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion makes no mention of the narrator\u2019s mother and doesn\u2019t address the narrator\u2019s relationship with her. Although the narrator mentions that her mother gave her permission as a child to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about the mother or her relationship to her child.",

The text says that Dingle \u201cskillfully winds\u201d parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that \u201cno factory can reproduce.\u201d This context suggests that Dingle\u2019s baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm.

The text explains that certain economic historians \u201cassumed\u201d that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. Choice B is incorrect.

Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians \u201cregretted,\u201d or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, \u201cconcede\u201d means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe \u201cBronze Age societies were ruled by men.\u201d But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included \u201cvaluable objects signaling a high position of power,\u201d which would raise the possibility that \u201cwomen may have also held leadership roles.\u201d Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. Choice A is incorrect because \u201cwaive\u201d means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn\u2019t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, \u201crefute\u201d means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team\u2019s finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \u201crequire\u201d means to demand or specify as mandatory.

At first \u201cirregular and misty,\u201d or haphazard and indistinct, the figure\u2019s outline gradually showed \u201cdistincter grace and beauty\u201d until the general design of the carved object \u201cwas now obvious to the common eye,\u201d or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cassumed\u201d can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can\u2019t acknowledge its own precision.

Choice A is incorrect because saying that Ochoa \u201cdemands,\u201d or insists or requires, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth\u2019s would not make sense in context.

The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context conveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not sufficiently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help. Choice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as \u201cprepared for\u201d\u2014or ready for\u2014speaking Quechua wouldn\u2019t make sense in context.

The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn\u2019t have. As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras. Choice B is incorrect because \u201cdelicate\u201d means fine in texture or structure or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn\u2019t focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it\u2019s breakable. Choice C is incorrect because \u201cinevitable\u201d means impossible to avoid, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text doesn\u2019t discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because \u201chabitual\u201d means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s. Jenkins\u2019s ability to take advantage of video cameras to make art was therefore newfound, not habitual, at the time.",

As used in this context, \u201ccomplexity\u201d means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are difficult to follow or explain. The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is difficult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that\u2019s challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can\u2019t do justice to the novel\u2019s complexity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word \u201caccuracy,\u201d or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn\u2019t discuss whether Tokarczuk\u2019s novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a difficult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because \u201cinactivity\u201d means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context.

The text portrays a woman who is looking at \u201ctrees in their spring beauty.\u201d She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the \u201ceasy unhuman loveliness\u201d of trees: she thinks of cities as \u201cseductive\u201d and \u201ccharming,\u201d both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them.

Such attractive qualities are not described by the word \u201csignaling\u201d alone. Therefore, \u201csignaling\u201d is an incorrect answer because it is insufficiently precise.

The text also indicates that historians ultimately decided the letters were a hoax, or fraudulent. This context suggests that the historians couldn\u2019t confirm that the letters were authentic.

In this context, \u201cinadequate\u201d means not satisfactory. The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes \u201cthe loss of material quality.\u201d The text contrasts that with Chazovachii\u2019s chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text\u2019s emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields.

Although the text suggests that there have been changes in the field of recycling, as is the case with the advent of Chazovachii\u2019s chemical recycling process, there is nothing to suggest that the mechanical process itself has changed or is prone to change. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \u201csatisfactory\u201d would mean acceptable but not perfect.

The text indicates that although the flashes that fireflies produce appear to occur randomly\u2014that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm\u2014each species actually produces its own special series of flashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of flashes are so unique that fireflies can use them to find other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that fireflies produce flashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. Choice A is incorrect because \u201cquantities\u201d means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different firefly species produce flashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to find them, it doesn\u2019t mention the number of flashes that are used in these sequences.

Although it may be reasonable to say that firefly flashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that fireflies use these unique sequences of flashes to find other members of their own species, not that the flashes make fireflies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \u201cagreements\u201d would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about.

Instead, the text focuses on Pico\u2019s mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature\u2019s role in his tribe\u2019s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his \u201crenunciation of\u201d nature would mean that he portrays himself as rejecting nature, which isn\u2019t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and negative responses toward nature, not that he\u2019s giving it up completely.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his \u201cmastery over\u201d nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn\u2019t supported by the text. The text focuses on Pico\u2019s mixed feelings about nature; nothing in the text suggests that Pico feels mastery over nature.",

In other words, they use technology to inspect small parts of matter that can\u2019t be seen by the naked eye. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time \u201cselecting,\u201d or choosing, subatomic particles for some purpose; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter.

The text indicates that Ashbery\u2019s poems have many unusual features, that it\u2019s difficult to tell what exactly the poems\u2019 subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it\u2019s difficult to interpret Ashbery\u2019s poems. Choice A is incorrect because \u201cdelegate\u201d means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context. The text is focused only on the difficulty that readers have interpreting Ashbery\u2019s poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn\u2019t suggest anything about the poems being difficult to delegate.

    "choices": ["A) Denying", "B) Entering", "C) Carrying", "D) Hearing"],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201creceiving\u201d most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, \u201chis ears could not help receiving the words\u201d). The words are being perceived specifically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance\u2019s ears couldn\u2019t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don\u2019t enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word \u201ccarry\u201d can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one \u201ccarries the blame\u201d for a mistake).",

In this context, to \u201csimulate\u201d most nearly means to represent a natural process using computer models. According to the text, understanding Earth\u2019s early climate is difficult because we cannot make direct observations of the distant past. Instead, scientists must create computer models that approximate early climate conditions, based on the physical evidence that those conditions left behind on Earth\u2019s surface. This context supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth\u2019s climate in the distant past. Choice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence\u00a0as a basis for developing computer models that describe what Earth\u2019s actual past climate might have been like.

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Southern Pacific Railroad. As used in this context, \"dominance\" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California\u2019s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California\u2019s coast. Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word \"creativity\" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California\u2019s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad\u2019s control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California\u2019s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its \"insignificance,\" or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad\u2019s \"neutrality,\" or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would \"neutrality\" in the sense of impartiality in a conflict be a logical or precise choice since no conflict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conflict between the Southern Pacific Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conflict in which the Southern Pacific Railroad would take an impartial position.",

The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are \u201cconsiderable variations\u201d in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays\u2019 age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to find out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity.

In this context, \u201censuring\u201d means guaranteeing, or making sure of, the cucurbits\u2019 survival. The text states that cucurbits faced extinction in the past because their means of seed dispersal disappeared, but the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began farming cucurbits around that same time, so the crops were no longer threatened. Therefore, the context supports the idea that the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America helped with ensuring the cucurbits\u2019 survival.

The text also presents the critics\u2019 view as being influenced by a perception that fine artists create works that are \u201ctimeless\u201d and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase. This context suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion tend not to overlap\u2014in other words, that they rarely intersect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that critics contend that fine art and fashion rarely \u201cprevail,\u201d or prove to be triumphant or widespread. The text indicates that Okuma is an example of an artist who demonstrates that it\u2019s possible to make fine art that is also available to the public as fashion. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that fine art and fashion rarely \u201csuccumb,\u201d or surrender. The text establishes that unlike what critics believe, Okuma creates works that are in art museums and available for the public to purchase, suggesting that critics believe fine art and fashion rarely overlap, not that they rarely succumb. Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely \u201cdiverge,\u201d or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text presents Okuma\u2019s work as both fine art and fashion, thereby undermining what the critics assert. This suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely intersect rather than that the two rarely diverge.",

In other words, each organism provides the same kind of benefit it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen). Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a \u201csymbiotic exchange\u201d in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus \u201coverreacts,\u201d or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient.

In this context, \u201csaturated with\u201d means thoroughly or completely supplied with. The text explains a problem encountered by some bicycle-sharing programs: users can return bicycles to different locations than where the users picked up the bicycles to start, which can result in a mismatch between bicycle supply (that is, where the bicycles are currently located) and user demand (that is, the locations where users are hoping to pick up bicycles). The text goes on to explain that Ikeguchi developed a way to identify when this mismatch is likely to occur. This context suggests that Ikeguchi\u2019s method will show when it is likely that some locations have an insufficient supply and other locations, by implicit contrast, are saturated with bicycles. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some locations are \u201csusceptible to,\u201d or sensitive to or easily influenced by, bicycles. The text describes the phenomenon of bicycles being redistributed away from locations where users want them, not anything about those locations being influenced by the bicycles.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the text describes situations in which some locations have an insufficient supply of bicycles because the bicycles have been relocated elsewhere, which suggests that the other locations have many bicycles, not that the other locations are \u201ccontingent on,\u201d or dependent on, the bicycles.

The text describes situations in which bicycles have been relocated such that there is a mismatch between bicycle supply and user demand\u2014the bicycles are no longer at the locations where users want to pick them up.

      "B) partnership",
      "C) discovery",
      "D) disagreement"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the cover art of Virginia Woolf\u2019s novels. In this context, \u201cpartnership\u201d means collaboration or joint effort. The text states that Woolf\u2019s sister Vanessa Bell was a talented painter and that Bell worked with Woolf to provide the cover art for most of Woolf\u2019s novels. Thus, this context suggests that Woolf and Bell pursued a creative partnership in order to produce several of Woolf\u2019s novels. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Woolf or Bell were undergoing a \u201crebellion,\u201d or revolt, against anything in particular. Instead, the text focuses on how they worked together in some aspects of the production of Woolf\u2019s novels. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a \u201cdiscovery,\u201d or encountered anything new for the first time as they worked together. The text suggests that Woolf had already written her novels and that Bell then assisted Woolf with the cover art for many of them. Choice D is incorrect because the text implies that Woolf and Bell had a positive relationship. According to the text, the sisters \u201cworked closely\u201d together to produce the cover art for many of Woolf\u2019s novels; the text doesn\u2019t mention whether while working together, Woolf and Bell had a \u201cdisagreement,\u201d or conflict.",

    "passage": "The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde\u2019s 1895 play *The Importance of Being Earnest*. CECILY: Have we got to part? ALGERNON: I am afraid so. It\u2019s a very painful parting. CECILY: It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time. The absence of old friends one can ==endure== with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable.",
    "choices": ["A) Regret", "B) Persist", "C) Tolerate", "D) Encourage"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201cendure\u201d most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cendure\u201d can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can\u2019t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others\u2019 absences, not on her treatment of others.",

In this context, \u201ccollected\u201d means acquired and took away. The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid\u2019s surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu. Choice A is incorrect because in this context \u201cattached\u201d means connected or affixed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn\u2019t suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid.

The text doesn\u2019t suggest that the spacecraft tracked the sample, and it\u2019s not clear what it would mean for the spacecraft to travel behind the sample it collected.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because in this context \u201creplaced\u201d means put back or returned.

As used in this context, \u201csynchronization\u201d means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant flower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before flowering. Choice B is incorrect because referring to \u201chibernation,\u201d or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in\u2014making use of a protein and producing flowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in \u201cprediction,\u201d or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about flowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular flowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to flower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to \u201cmoderation,\u201d or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant\u2019s flowering activity; the two plants simply flower in unison.",

In this context, \u201cintroduced\u201d means brought into practice or use. The text states that the first reference to a seven-day week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. The text presents this information about the seven-day week as an example of a concept introduced by the Sumerian civilization that persists into present-day civilizations. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization \u201ctransformed,\u201d or changed the nature of, concepts that persist into present-day civilizations.

Choice C is incorrect because \u201cwarned\u201d means informed someone in advance about something dangerous, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Juarez. In this context, \u201cimportant\u201d means marked by significant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, became a certain kind of figure in Mexico\u2019s history. It then supports that claim by describing some of the \u201cmany significant accomplishments\u201d from Juarez\u2019s long tenure in office. This context conveys that Juarez is a significant and consequential figure in Mexico\u2019s history. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez\u2019s role as the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was \u201cunpredictable,\u201d or tended to behave in ways that couldn\u2019t be predicted. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was a particularly \u201csecretive\u201d figure, or that he tended to keep things private or hidden from others. Instead, the text focuses on things that are known about Juarez: that he was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, that he had a lengthy tenure, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national government\u2019s authority and advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office. Rather than suggesting that Juarez was an \u201cordinary,\u201d or common and typical, figure in Mexico\u2019s history, this context conveys that Juarez was instead a notable figure.",

As used in this context, \u201cpredicted\u201d means forecast, or indicated that something would happen in the future. The text indicates that the fashion resale market made a lot of money in 2019 and that some analysts expected the market to continue to grow. This context suggests that the analysts believed that the fashion resale market was going to make more money than it had already made, with the analysts indicating that revenues would more than double by 2028. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that some analysts \u201cproduced,\u201d or manufactured or brought about, the increase in future revenues of the fashion resale market. The analysts themselves couldn\u2019t have brought about the future revenue growth, since, as the text suggests, they were merely in the position of drawing conclusions about future fashion resale market revenue based on 2019 revenue. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they \u201cdenied,\u201d or rejected, this notion. Nothing in the text supports the idea that these analysts thought the revenues wouldn\u2019t grow. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they \u201cworried,\u201d or felt concerned, that revenue would significantly increase by 2028. Nothing in the text suggests that the analysts felt concerned about the increase; rather, the text suggests that the increase would represent a favorable outcome, since it would mean that the fashion resale market grew to generate even more revenue.",

The text indicates that Zepeda\u2019s many accomplishments in linguistics are varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetry in more than one language, creating a grammar book, and co-founding a language institute. This context supports the idea that Zepeda\u2019s contributions to the field are extensive. Choice A is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda\u2019s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence.

In this context, \u201cabrupt\u201d means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reflects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversification, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period. This context establishes that these remains\u2019 entry into the fossil record was sudden. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word \u201cexplosion\u201d appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d or disastrous. In context, \u201cexplosion\u201d refers to the rapid diversification, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record\u2014a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversification is \u201celusive,\u201d or difficult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as \u201cimminent,\u201d or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago.",

In this context, \u201ccollaboration\u201d means working together with someone to write a literary work.

The text indicates that interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics \u201chave challenged\u201d the economist\u2019s claim that sales of personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the economist\u2019s projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist\u2019s projection entirely\u2014the delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to \u201cdispute,\u201d or argue against, the economist\u2019s projection wouldn\u2019t make sense.

The text describes Mary\u2019s surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there\u2019s \"a little wind.\" To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word \"rough\" with a description of the wind blowing in \"delightful little gusts,\" suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"rough\" objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn\u2019t mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, \"delightful little gusts,\" which suggests that the use of \"rough\" here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn\u2019t \"basic,\" or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in \"delightful little gusts.\" Choice D is incorrect because the word \"vague\" means not clearly expressed or seen. Nothing in the text indicates that the wind was barely noticeable to Mary as she played outside, but rather the text states that it was delightful.",

    "passage": "The following text is adapted from Amy Lowell\u2019s 1912 poem \u201cSummer.\u201d It is summer, glorious, deep-toned summer, The very crown of nature\u2019s changing year When all her surging life is at its full.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, a span of time is described as \"a void\" space, which most nearly means an empty or vacant one. In the text, the speaker describes summertime in counterintuitive terms: although nature\u2019s \"surging life is at its full\" during the season, the speaker feels summer to be \"a time of pause, / A void and silent space between two worlds.\" The speaker says further that during summer, \"feeling sleeps / Gathering strength\" for future efforts. Thus, the speaker regards summer as an empty stretch of time, to be followed by a period of greater activity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does present summer as a time of inactivity, it doesn\u2019t characterize that inactivity as useless, or as having no purpose; in fact, the speaker regards summer as a time when \"feeling\" gathers \"strength for efforts yet to come.\" Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes summer as a time \"when inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps,\" it doesn\u2019t discuss the season\u2019s relationship to the speaker\u2019s memory or suggest that summer can easily be forgotten. Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, \"void\" can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness. However, the text doesn\u2019t portray summer as not being complete or whole; instead, it characterizes vacancy or inactivity as being an essential quality of the season, as experienced by the speaker.",

As used in this context, \u201covershadowed by\u201d means to be surpassed by or caused to seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to be more important than state taxes. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren\u2019t as important a consideration as other factors when people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn\u2019t suggest that state taxes are \u201cconsistent with,\u201d or in agreement with these other factors.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that state taxes are \u201crepresentative of,\u201d or typical of, other factors.

In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable to have an opinion about state taxes.

This context suggests that these discoveries provide evidence for the archaeologists\u2019 theory about the dating of the amphitheater.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201csimply\u201d most nearly means easily, or involving minimal difficulty or effort. The text first provides Alice\u2019s reflections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel\u2019s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be efficiently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice\u2019s plan is that it can be easily arranged. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice\u2019s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that it can be arranged \u201cfaintly,\u201d or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201csimply\u201d can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word \u201chastily\u201d indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice\u2019s plan was made in haste, the text doesn\u2019t focus on this aspect of her plan.

The text indicates that Gilliam is an artist who made draped canvases and, later, quilt-like paintings.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of baleen whale accessory spleens. In this context, \u201clatent\u201d means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales\u2019 diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is \u201creplicable,\u201d or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn\u2019t address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn\u2019t be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is \u201cpredetermined,\u201d or decided in advance, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn\u2019t been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales.

As used in this context, \u201cperipheral\u201d means situated toward the outer bounds rather than the center. The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required \u201ca long overland journey.\u201d This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire\u2019s territory rather than near its center. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco\u2019s location within the Aztec Empire as \u201cunobtrusive,\u201d or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it\u2019s not clear how a province\u2019s physical location would or wouldn\u2019t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco\u2019s location was, the text emphasizes the province\u2019s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required \u201ca long overland journey.\u201d Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was \u201cconcealed,\u201d or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn\u2019t see it, and being hidden wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring \u201ca long overland journey.\u201d Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco\u2019s location within the Aztec Empire was \u201capproximate\u201d would mean that the location either wasn\u2019t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco\u2019s location is known and that it was far from the empire\u2019s capital, so there\u2019s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location.",

The text indicates that \u201cpeople can take simple steps\u201d to avoid bringing possible invasive species into new environments.

As used in this context, \u201cconfined to\u201d means restricted to. The text says that Vel\u00e1zquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were influenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s influence was hardly (or almost not) confined to, or restricted to, Spain. Choice A is incorrect because if Vel\u00e1zquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn\u2019t make logical sense to claim that his influence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s techniques would by definition be influenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Vel\u00e1zquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his influence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that deliberately limiting Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s influence outside Spain was ever considered by anyone. Thus, even if it is true that his influence was not repressed, or restrained, it doesn\u2019t make logical sense to say so in this context.",

The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they \u201cdon\u2019t strictly observe every tradition.\u201d By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques. Choice A is incorrect because in this context \u201cexperiment with\u201d would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members \u201cdon\u2019t strictly observe every tradition.\u201d The phrase \u201cexperiment with\u201d wouldn\u2019t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions.

As used in this context, \"transformed\" means substantially changed in some way. The text states that the invention radically altered the semiconductor industry, with some historians claiming that it had a fundamental effect on the industry by allowing for mass production for the first time. This context conveys that the invention of the integrated circuit transformed the semiconductor industry. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the invention of the integrated circuit significantly affected (\"radically altered\") the semiconductor industry, it doesn\u2019t indicate that the invention \"overwhelmed\" the industry, which in this context would mean that it overcame the industry such that the industry struggled or was defeated. Instead, the text conveys that the invention\u2019s effect was positive, since it allowed the semiconductor industry to begin making use of mass production methods. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that the invention of the integrated circuit \"bypassed\" the semiconductor industry, which would mean it intentionally avoided the industry. The text indicates that the invention directly affected the semiconductor industry, since it made it possible for the industry to begin engaging in mass production methods.

In this context, \"reduced\" means decreased. The text presents the finding from a team of neuroeconomists that decision making may be connected to communication between the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. In presenting this finding, the text suggests a contrast between people who tend to be more decisive and people who make decisions more slowly. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between the two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. On the other hand, this context suggests that people make choices more slowly when the flow of information between the two brain regions is decreased. Choice B is incorrect because \"evaluated\" means assessed, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people\u2019s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to assess the information.

    "choices": ["A) invented", "B) adjusted", "C) featured", "D) recommended"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Ester Hernandez\u2019s art. In this context, \"featured\" means shown prominently. The text focuses on where Hernandez\u2019s works have been and continue to be displayed, explaining that her early works, which consisted of murals, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San Francisco. The central contrast developed in the text is between where her early works could be viewed and where her works can be viewed now, which is in museums across the United States and around the world. The context therefore supports the idea that Hernandez\u2019s works are now shown, or featured, in museums globally. Choice A is incorrect because in this context \"invented\" would mean created something for the first time, which isn\u2019t supported since the text doesn\u2019t discuss where Hernandez creates her works or whether they\u2019re original or innovative. Choice B is incorrect because \"adjusted\" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez\u2019s early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez\u2019s works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez\u2019s works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works. Choice D is incorrect because \"recommended\" in this context would mean endorsed or put forth as a suggestion for something that is worth seeing. Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn\u2019t discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez\u2019s works.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the W boson. In this context, \"scale\" means size or extent. The text indicates that recent measurements of the W boson were remarkable because they revealed the subatomic particle\u2019s mass to be much greater (\"seven standard deviations higher\") than had been expected based on a standard model. This context conveys not only that the measurements differed from predictions but also that the extent of the difference was very large. Choice A is incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the measurements of the subatomic particle were notable because they differed from expectations and also because a difference existed between the measurements and what had been predicted; the text would be repeating the idea that there was a difference instead of adding to that idea.

Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"recognizable\" would mean identifiable, and since the text indicates that noses are often missing from ancient statues, they therefore cannot be the most recognizable part of the statue. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many ancient statues are missing noses, so noses wouldn\u2019t be \"common,\" or frequent, aspects of ancient statues; they would conversely be uncommon. Choice D is incorrect because the text only indicates that noses on ancient statues often stick out and end up missing from the heads, which doesn\u2019t relate to the noses being \"sophisticated,\" or knowledgeable or refined.",

The text describes a study in which cuttlefish demonstrated an ability to exercise restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of eating a meal that was already available to them. That is, by delaying gratification, the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated that they were capable of, or competent at, exercising self-control. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstrating self-control, cuttlefish are \"awkward,\" or lacking skill or grace.

As used in this context \"intangible\" means unable to be physically handled or touched. The text states that star formations cannot be touched, and then goes on to explain that Imara created a special model to research star formations. In other words, despite the fact that real star formations are intangible, thanks to Imara, researchers can handle models of star formations to better understand them. Choice A is incorrect because \"repeatable\" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form are untouchable, but that Nia Imara has produced interactive models of them. It would therefore be illogical to suggest that Imara believes that the formations need not be duplicated and then go on to say that she has copied them. Choice B is incorrect because \"explicable\" means explainable or understandable, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imara believes that star formations can be fully explained but rather that she produced interactive models to physically study them because researchers are unable to touch them directly.

The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as \"the multitude of Paris,\" meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi\u2019s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi\u2019s attempt to drive down the street. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn\u2019t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn\u2019t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi\u2019s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi\u2019s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time.

Generally, a roof\u2019s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive\u2014that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn\u2019t limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion.",

    "passage": "The following text is from the 1989 novel *The Ancient Child* by Kiowa writer N. Scott Momaday. The main character has achieved tremendous commercial success as a painter. More and more often he was asked to compromise his art or himself in one way or another, and more often than not he did so, for he was inclined to be passive and na\u00efve; it was difficult for him to say no. Those who exhibited his work, who praised and purchased it, and who demanded its proliferation began to determine it. \u00a91989 by N. Scott Momaday",
    "choices": ["A) Conclude", "B) Dictate", "C) Evaluate", "D) Select"],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text \"determine\" most nearly means \"dictate.\" The text describes the relationship between the main character and those who exhibit, praise, and purchase his artwork. The text states that the main character is often asked to change his art or himself based on outside influences, and he usually acquiesces. Because the main character admits that those who support his work often shape it based on their demands, it follows that those outside influences dictate, or guide or dominate, the direction his work takes. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that outside influences \"conclude,\" or end, the main character\u2019s work. The text states that many supporters of the main character\u2019s art \"demand its proliferation,\" not its conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that outside influences are \"evaluating,\" or judging the main character\u2019s work. According to the text, the main character\u2019s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character\u2019s work and are not questioning or evaluating its success or worth. They are instead influencing its initial direction. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that outside influences \"select,\" or choose the main character\u2019s work. According to the text, the main character\u2019s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character\u2019s work and are not selecting it. They are instead influencing its initial direction.",

    "choices": ["A) inspire", "B) ignore", "C) promote", "D) reduce"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the preservation efforts undertaken by Erika Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana. In this context, \"promote\" means play a part in the success or growth of something or someone. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes work to preserve culturally important sites. It goes on to say that their decision to create a national trail connecting the sites was motivated by the fact that such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn\u2019t otherwise receive. Thus, such a decision would promote the preservation efforts. Choice A is incorrect because \"inspire\" means motivate or influence, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text establishes that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that their decision to create a new national trail occurred as a result of a desire to add protections to the sites that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise receive. Thus, creating the trail wouldn\u2019t inspire the efforts to preserve the sites; instead, it would promote the efforts. Choice B is incorrect because \"ignore\" means overlook, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn\u2019t otherwise receive. Thus, the creation of the trail would promote, not ignore, the preservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect because \"reduce\" means decrease or restrict, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn\u2019t otherwise receive. The decision would therefore promote, not reduce, the preservation efforts.",

    "passage": "The way in which individual elements are balanced within a photographic image tends to affect how viewers perceive it: symmetry tends to give the elements equal importance, asymmetry emphasizes differences, and radial balance (organizing the elements around a central point) emphasizes the center over the periphery. What a photograph conveys is therefore largely ______blank how it is balanced.",

      "A) inhibited by",
      "B) contingent on",
      "C) obligated to",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of visual balance in photography. In this context, \"contingent on\" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inhibited by\" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"obligated to\" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph\u2019s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"reserved for\" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose. The text as a whole does not support the claim that a photograph\u2019s message is reserved for how that photograph is balanced.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd. As used in this context, \"inconsequential to\" means not significant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd\u2019s works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his influence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren\u2019t inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period. Choice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd\u2019s time had access to his works, not whether his works were \"controversial among,\" or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd\u2019s era were aware of his works, not that they were \"antagonistic toward,\" or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd\u2019s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"imitated by\" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd\u2019s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn\u2019t specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn\u2019t support the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd\u2019s works.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of imported goods and consumer prices. In this context, \"nullify\" most nearly means negate or undermine. The text indicates that importing goods to a country can reduce consumer prices in that country, then cautions that the costs of transporting goods within the country is also a factor. These transportation costs likely raise the prices that must be paid by people who live far from the ports of entry. Therefore, the intranational transportation costs could nullify the price advantages to consumers of importing goods. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"denigrate\" would most nearly mean disparage or deny the importance of. Since transportation costs would not be capable of denying the importance of price advantages, it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs denigrate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"underestimate\" would most nearly mean predict a lower value for, or to undervalue, someone or something. Though transportation costs might be undervalued, they cannot themselves undervalue something else, so it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs underestimate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"misconstrue\" would most nearly mean misunderstand.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Carmen Lomas Garza\u2019s artistic process. In this context, \"inspired by\" means influenced by or motivated by. The text refers to how, regardless of the scale of the work, Garza uses her memories of Texas and details from California to create her art. If Garza is basing her work on her direct experiences, then they play a part in her artistic process. This context thus suggests that Garza\u2019s art is inspired by the experiences of her childhood in Texas and her current life in California. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make logical sense to indicate that Garza is \"complimented by\"\u2014or praised by\u2014something inanimate such as direct experience. Choice B is incorrect because describing Garza as \"uncertain about\"\u2014or unsure or doubtful of\u2014direct experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza were unsure of her experiences, that would suggest that she couldn\u2019t recall them, and Garza wouldn\u2019t be able to represent direct experience in her art if she were uncertain of the memories or details. Choice C is incorrect because describing Garza as \"unbothered by\"\u2014or uninterested in\u2014her experience would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about Garza\u2019s artistic process.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \"invent\" most nearly means create or make up. The text begins by stating that Sara likes to tell stories and thoroughly enjoys telling them. The rest of the text describes how she looks and acts when she invents, or creates, \"wonderful things\" in her stories (\"what she told\"). Choice A is incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is disguising, or trying to cover up or conceal, \"wonderful things\" when she tells stories; rather, she is creating them and presenting them in ways that make them \"lovely or alarming\" for her listeners.

The text states that manul cats live in \"out-of-the-way parts of Asia\" (citing the famously remote Mount Everest as an example) and indicates that it is difficult to research the cats because of the location of their habitats. By emphasizing that the habitats are remote in relation to humans, the text conveys that being \"distant from,\" or far from, large groups of humans makes manul cats challenging to study. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the habitats of manul cats are \"full of large populations of humans\" would indicate that the cats cohabitate with many humans, which would directly contradict the text\u2019s claim that the cats live in \"out-of-the-way\" areas. Choice B is incorrect because the missing words describe an aspect of manul cats\u2019 habitats, or the areas where they live, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that areas could be \"drawn to,\" or attracted by, large groups of humans.

In this context, \"inexpensive\" means less costly or low in price. The passage describes two kinds of methods that can be used to \"detect objects or people through walls\": radar and sonar, and changes to the Wi-Fi technology used in smartphones. The word \"comparatively\" before the blank indicates that the best answer would be one that helps to describe a comparison between the two. Radar and sonar are described as \"costly,\" while the method that uses Wi-Fi technology is described as \"cheap\"; therefore, it would be comparatively affordable, or inexpensive.

As used in this context, \"responsive\" means reacting positively. The text presents a finding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean sounds may encourage oyster larvae to establish a reef (a permanent home): groups of oyster larvae that heard recorded sounds of a healthy oyster reef were two times more likely to show signs of forming their own reef than groups that heard different ocean recordings were. This context conveys that the groups that heard healthy reef sounds had a more positive reaction than the other groups did\u2014that is, they were the most responsive. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to become \"inactive,\" or to stop engaging in work or activity. Instead, the text conveys that the groups that heard those sounds were observed engaging in activity: they were two times more likely to create a reef (a permanent home) than groups that heard different ocean sounds were. Choice C is incorrect because describing the groups of oyster larvae that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef as most \"liked,\" or regarded with pleasure, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a study found that healthy reef sounds may encourage groups of oyster larvae to form reefs (permanent homes), not on the idea that some of the groups in the study were liked more than others. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to be \"distressed,\" or to experience difficulty or begin to decline.

Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is bland, or uninteresting; rather, she notices the sound and comments on how \"nice\" it is.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the dating of Machu Picchu. In this context, \"original\" means first or initial. The text indicates that Lucy Salazar and her colleagues have determined the age of Machu Picchu and that the age differs from another estimate of the site\u2019s age, explaining that the site is about 20 years older than scholars thought in 1911 when they initially encountered Machu Picchu. In other words, Salazar and her team found that the site\u2019s age differs from the first estimate. Choice A is incorrect. The text\u2019s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"genuine,\" or actual and true, while the one by Salazar\u2019s team wasn\u2019t, since the text treats the finding by Salazar\u2019s team as true and as invalidating the earlier estimate (\"it is approximately 20 years older than scholars thought\"). Choice B is incorrect. The text\u2019s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"intentional,\" or done on purpose, while the one by Salazar\u2019s team wasn\u2019t; the text indicates that Salazar and her colleagues were deliberately using radiocarbon dating to study Machu Picchu. Choice C is incorrect. The text\u2019s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. There\u2019s no reason to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"independent,\" or not controlled by or affiliated with others, while the one by Salazar\u2019s team wasn\u2019t; there\u2019s no mention of any outside influence on the work by Salazar and her team or by scholars in 1911.",

    "passage": "Eighteenth-century historian Edward Gibbon thought the only character defect of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius was his mild temperament\u2014though the emperor was widely considered virtuous, his overly permissive nature led him to ______blank the vices of those who surrounded him.",
    "choices": ["A) indulge", "B) despise", "C) moderate", "D) criticize"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. In this context, \"indulge\" means treat with excessive leniency. The text states that according to historian Edward Gibbon, Marcus Aurelius, who was widely considered virtuous, had only a single character flaw: his mild temperament. The text suggests that because of this flaw, Marcus Aurelius had an overly permissive nature. This context, in turn, supports the idea that Marcus Aurelius treated the vices, or evils, of those around him with excessive leniency, indulging rather than punishing those vices. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Marcus Aurelius was widely considered virtuous, it gives no indication that he was inclined to \"despise,\" or hate, others\u2019 vices. Rather, the text suggests that he showed undue tolerance for these vices because of his overly permissive nature\u2014that is, his inclination to allow others to do as they wished. Choice C is incorrect because the text\u2019s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others\u2019 vices, not that he tried to \"moderate\" those vices, or lessen their intensity. Choice D is incorrect because the text\u2019s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others\u2019 vices, not that he attempted to \"criticize,\" or speak disapprovingly of, those vices.",

    "choices": ["A) forgetting", "B) rejection", "C) imitation", "D) opinion"],

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of novelist Leon Forrest\u2019s admiration of William Faulkner\u2019s writing style. In this context, \"imitation\" means something that resembles or reproduces something else. The text states that Forrest admired Faulkner\u2019s style and that anyone familiar with Faulkner\u2019s style would be able to see the stylistic similarities between a particular passage in Forrest\u2019s novel Divine Days and Faulkner\u2019s writing, a fact that supports the idea that Forrest\u2019s novel pays tribute to Faulkner by reproducing, or imitating, Faulkner\u2019s style. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, a \"forgetting\" would mean an instance in which something is overlooked or not remembered. The text emphasizes Forrest\u2019s admiration for Faulkner\u2019s style and the fact that Forrest\u2019s writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner\u2019s stylistically. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner\u2019s style, Forrest failed to remember it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, a \"rejection\" would mean a dismissal of something as unworthy. The text emphasizes Forrest\u2019s admiration for Faulkner\u2019s writing style, stating that parts of Forrest\u2019s writings indicate efforts to copy that style. It wouldn\u2019t make sense therefore to suggest that Forrest had rejected or dismissed Faulkner\u2019s style as unworthy. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, an \"opinion\" would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on Forrest\u2019s admiration of Faulkner, which suggests that Forrest had formed a positive judgment of Faulkner\u2019s style, the word opinion wouldn\u2019t make sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn\u2019t say that the passage from Forrest\u2019s novel expresses his view of Faulkner\u2019s style; rather, it suggests that stylistically, the passage closely resembles, or imitates, Faulkner\u2019s writing.",

It then goes on to describe what the photograph showed, or displayed, which is a portrait of Nina\u2019s great-great-grandmother Rosita as a young woman. Thus, the text indicates that the photograph displayed a portrait of Rosita.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the art at the National Museum of the American Indian. In this context, \"homogenous\" means uniform or highly similar. The text explains that the painters whose works are included in this museum\u2019s collection employ an array of artistic styles, both Native and non-Native, traditional and new. Given this high degree of stylistic diversity, it is a misconception that Native art is uniform, or homogenous. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t consider whether Native art is controversial, or causes disagreement or discussion; instead, the text discusses the stylistic diversity of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some of the artists whose work is represented in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian blend various artistic traditions into highly individual styles of their own, this is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text is concerned with how Native art is often mistakenly perceived as uniform, when in fact it is stylistically diverse. Choice C is incorrect because the text never implies that people mistakenly conceive of Native art as theoretical, or concerned with philosophical or abstract issues; instead, the text\u2019s discussion of Native art is framed around this art\u2019s stylistic diversity versus the misconception of it as homogenous.",

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text \"reaching across to\" most nearly means stretching toward. The text begins with Mrs. Wilkins stating that she wants to have one of the oranges that she\u2019s admiring. The text then indicates that Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she is, holds out a big orange to her friend. This context suggests that when the text describes Mrs. Wilkins as reaching across to the bowl of oranges, it means that she is stretching toward the bowl. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is joining with, or becoming attached to, the bowl of oranges. Rather, the text indicates that she is stretching toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is gaining on, or overtaking in a competition or race, the bowl of oranges. The text suggests instead that the bowl is sitting still on a surface and that Mrs. Wilkins is extending her arm toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Mrs. Wilkins is arriving at the bowl of oranges.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing \"similarities with\" means having some resemblance to. The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren\u2019t closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are \"examples of,\" or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren\u2019t closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can\u2019t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"concerns about\" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indications of\" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn\u2019t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups.",

    "choices": ["A) defunct", "B) arcane", "C) ubiquitous", "D) extraneous"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of artworks that were produced for exhibition on the internet. In this context, \"defunct\" means no longer existing or functioning. According to the text, many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible due to their reliance on certain software. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim\u2019s Genesis, which relied on software that was discontinued in 2021. This context supports the idea that the software is defunct. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that viewing artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet requires the use of software. Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is \"arcane,\" or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it\u2019s now defunct. Choice C is incorrect because \"ubiquitous\" would mean found everywhere, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them. According to the text, one example of such software is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it\u2019s now defunct. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the software used to view artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is \"extraneous,\" or irrelevant.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Kelmscott Press\u2019s books. In this context, \"manifest in\" means evident or apparent from. The text states that the Kelmscott Press, which was cofounded by William Morris, produced its books using preindustrial methods. The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization is \"insensible to,\" or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization. Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense to say that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization was \"scrutinized by,\" or examined closely by, the Kelmscott editions\u2019 use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation. Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris\u2019s work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris\u2019s attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization is \"complicated by,\" or made more complex or difficult by, the Kelmscott Press\u2019s use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books.

This context conveys that there is little agreement when it comes to these categories.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the early British postal system. In this context, \"reforms\" most nearly means attempts at improving something. The text indicates that the pay-upon-delivery postage method led to fee avoidance on the part of recipients. It then says that action was taken to improve the postal system, giving examples such as the move to having the sender pay and affixing stamps to indicate payment had been received. These represent revisions to the system intended to improve its functioning; therefore, \"reforms\" most logically completes the text. Choice A is incorrect.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of wild rice. As used in this context, \"sensitive\" means vulnerable or easily affected. The text indicates that climate change is causing the lakes to get deeper, which consequently threatens the wild rice that grows in the area. The text goes on to state that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to uproot from the bottom of the lake. This context supports the idea that the plants are sensitive to water depth during early stages of development. Choice A is incorrect because \"immune\" means protected or shielded, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text explains that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to become uprooted and destroyed, indicating that these plants are harmed by deep water, not protected from it. Choice C is incorrect because \"limited\" means confined or restrained, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text explains that water depth can negatively affect young wild-rice plants but doesn\u2019t suggest that water depth limits or restrains the plants.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the origins of the unique dialect of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico. In this context, \"traced\" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Ta\u00ednos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba. Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"surrendered,\" or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been \"announced,\" or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"offered,\" or presented as a gift, to the pronunciation in Yoruba.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of environmental management along the US and Mexican border. In this context, \"requires\" means needs in order to perform a task. The text indicates that because ecosystems span the border, actions taken by the government on one side of the border can affect the environment in the nation on the other side of the border, which makes international cooperation crucial. In other words, because actions on one side of the US and Mexican border can affect the other side of the border, managing environmental matters along the border requires coordination between the two governments. Choice B is incorrect because \"praises\" in this context would mean to express a favorable judgment, but the text doesn\u2019t describe approval expressed by anyone, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that environmental management itself praises intergovernmental coordination. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"reports\" would mean gives an account. Although coordination between the US and Mexican governments likely would involve some sort of reporting, the text doesn\u2019t describe any such practice. Choice D is incorrect.

At supper time, Fox-Foot would allow no fire to be built, no landing to be made, no ==trace== of their passing to be left.

In other words, Fox-Foot doesn\u2019t want there to be any trace, or evidence, of the group\u2019s movements (\"their passing\") through the area. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Fox-Foot doesn\u2019t want the group to be detected, not that he doesn\u2019t want their presence to create a blemish, or a spoiling flaw, in the area; human activity could disturb a natural environment, but the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is instead focused on avoiding giving any sign of the group\u2019s movements through a place (\"their passing\") to anyone who might be following them. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on Fox-Foot\u2019s desire to avoid detection by those who might be following the group. This context conveys that Fox-Foot doesn\u2019t want to create any signs or evidence of the group moving through a place (\"their passing\"), not that he doesn\u2019t want to leave behind some quantity of their presence; indeed, it isn\u2019t clear what an amount of a group\u2019s movement would be. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the group has a sketch, or rough drawing, of their movements through that area (\"their passing\") that might be left behind.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of solar energy collection and storage. In this context, \"fluctuations in\" means irregular changes in. The text notes that economists recommend that countries that want to rely more on solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) should attempt to expand their storage capacity. The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of \"unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze\"\u2014that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that having ample solar energy stored and ready to use can mitigate the issue of fluctuations in solar energy collection caused by irregular patterns of sunlight availability. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"developments of solar energy collection\" would most clearly refer to the creation of ways to collect solar energy (energy captured from sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (\"cloud cover and haze\"); there\u2019s no reason to think that the creation of new collection methods would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated.

The text goes on to state that some cities are establishing incentives to promote small business shopping. This context supports the idea that some cities are instituting programs to encourage this consumer behavior. Choice B is incorrect because saying that some cities are \"occupying,\" or forcibly holding possession or control of, programs that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses wouldn\u2019t make sense in context.

The text draws a contrast between the lack of \"deliberately signaled\" political themes in women-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about women-authored science fiction from the 1970s. This contrast implies that the work from the 1970s did clearly reflect feminist political themes. In other words, the text indicates that unlike women who wrote science fiction in the 1920s to the 1960s, the women who wrote science fiction in the 1970s expressed overtly feminist themes. Choice A is incorrect. In this context \"prudently\" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science fiction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"cordially\" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a significant factor for women writing science fiction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s.

In this context, \"accidental\" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos\u2019s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos\u2019s findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos\u2019s findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics\u2019 opinion regarding the kea\u2019s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea\u2019s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics\u2019 opinion in this context must be that the kea\u2019s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental. Choice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos\u2019s claim that the kea\u2019s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea\u2019s usage of stones \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea\u2019s stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea\u2019s usage of small stones was \"obvious,\" or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea\u2019s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea\u2019s usage of small stones was \"observable,\" or visible, this would not conflict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea\u2019s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.",

The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can \"exceed,\" or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.

The text indicates that the magnetic fields of some metals change under stress and that Saleem and colleagues showed that it is possible to measure those changes from a distance, thereby demonstrating that the integrity of underground metal pipes can be evaluated without having to unearth them. This context thus indicates that Saleem and colleagues made productive use of, or exploited, this tendency of the metals\u2019 magnetic fields.

      "A) antecedent",
      "B) impending",
      "C) innocuous",
      "D) perpetual"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of advance indications of solar flares. In this context the word \"impending\" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun\u2019s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful\u2014solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth\u2014and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic\u2014increased brightness in a particular region of the corona\u2014comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending. Choice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun\u2019s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were \"antecedent,\" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word \"innocuous,\" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist. But the word \"perpetual,\" or never-ending, would in context indicate that the flare exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun\u2019s corona, which would not make logical sense.",

    "passage": "Latro, the main character of Gene Wolfe\u2019s novel *Soldier of the Mist*, is a man in ancient Greece. He completely loses his memory whenever he sleeps. So, before sleeping, Latro records the important experiences of each day on a scroll, carefully choosing which ones to ______blank.",
    "choices": ["A) suspect", "B) preserve", "C) suggest", "D) imagine"],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latro, the main character in Gene Wolfe\u2019s novel Soldier of the Mist. In this context, \"preserve\" means save or keep from destruction or loss. The text describes Latro as a character who loses his memory whenever he sleeps. The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss. Choice A is incorrect because \"suspect\" would mean mistrust, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"suggest\" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"imagine\" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it\u2019s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he\u2019s fabricating the experiences he records.",

      "C) Remembered",
      "D) Celebrated"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, \"mingled\" most nearly means combined. In the text, the speaker refers to several concepts mingling together and then compares this to \"the blending of\" two other things (an exotic plant and the fragrance of a strange flower). This comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts of love, April, and the gold of someone\u2019s hair as being blended together, or combined. Choice A is incorrect because \"mingled\" means combined, not identified. The speaker names several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone\u2019s hair) and then moves to a comparison of their mingling together to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower, conveying the idea that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined. Choice C is incorrect. The text as a whole may refer to a memory, but the comparison of the mingling of several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone\u2019s hair) to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower conveys that the speaker views those concepts as actually blended together, or combined, and not simply remembered at the same time. Choice D is incorrect. The speaker refers to several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone\u2019s hair) and then compares the mingling together of those concepts to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower; rather than suggesting that the concepts are celebrated, this comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined.",

    "choices": ["A) distinct", "B) required", "C) unintended", "D) unknown"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Ronyoung Kim\u2019s novel Clay Walls. In this context, \"distinct\" means clearly separate and different. The text indicates that the novel consists of three sections and that each section is narrated from the perspective of a different character. This context supports the idea that Kim\u2019s novel features three distinct perspectives. Choice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim\u2019s novel as \"required,\" or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. When writing a novel, a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There\u2019s nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim. Instead, the text focuses on identifying the three different perspectives featured in Kim\u2019s novel. Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim\u2019s novel as \"unintended,\" or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel. Choice D is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim\u2019s novel as \"unknown,\" or not revealed, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text directly identifies the three perspectives that appear in her novel as those of Faye and her two parents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the novel\u2019s perspectives are in fact known.",

Although the text mentions that Yamaoka lived in the apartment for four years, it doesn\u2019t address how long someone can beneficially live in a home surrounded by fanciful features or whether doing so can be sustained.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions the potential benefits of living in a home with disorienting design features, it doesn\u2019t suggest that this is the most effective method to create a physically stimulating environment.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text refers to Yamaoka to support the claim that Gins and Arakawa\u2019s apartment building design may be beneficial, but the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Yamaoka supports the designs of other conceptual artists.",

Rather than indicating that Pando isn\u2019t producing young trees anymore, the text reveals that Pando is indeed producing young trees, stating that those trees can be protected from grazing deer by strong fences. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that fences can be used to prevent deer from eating Pando\u2019s young trees, not that Pando itself can\u2019t grow in new areas because it\u2019s blocked by fences.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text offers no evidence that Pando\u2019s root system is incapable of supporting new trees or is otherwise a cause of worry for ecologists.",

Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama\u2019s books. In the text, Heidi screams upon first seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that\u2019s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi\u2019s eyes as \u201cglowing\u201d and states that she \u201cdevoured the scene,\u201d suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book. Choice A is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as \u201clooking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures\u201d in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she\u2019s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon first seeing the image, the text\u2019s description of the image and Heidi\u2019s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text describes the images in the book as \u201csplendid\u201d and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather than frightening.

The text goes on to say that the existence of the Wigner crystal remained unconfirmed until Feng Wang and colleagues were able to make an impression of one using two semiconductors and an ultrathin sheet of graphene. Thus, the main idea is that researchers have obtained the most definitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal.

    "passage": "In superfluorescence, electrical charges known as dipoles emit light in synchronized bursts so intense that they are visible to the eye. Until recently, this phenomenon has only been observed at extremely cold temperatures because dipoles cannot synchronize at higher temperatures. But in a study, Melike Biliroglu and colleagues observed superfluorescence at room temperature in thin films made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials; the researchers propose that the formation of shock-absorbing quasiparticles called polarons in the material protects dipoles from thermal interference.",

      "A) Polarons enable superfluorescent bursts to cross from one crystalline material to another.",
      "B) Polarons allow for the dipoles to synchronize despite higher temperatures.",
      "C) Polarons accelerate the dipoles\u2019 release of superfluorescent bursts.",
      "D) Polarons decrease the intensity of the superfluorescent burst."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes Biliroglu and colleagues\u2019 claim about how the polarons function in relation to superfluorescence. The text indicates that \u201cuntil recently,\u201d superfluorescence (intense, synchronized bursts of light emitted by dipoles) has solely been observed at very cold temperatures. However, it also states that, recently, Biliroglu and colleagues report observing the phenomenon at room temperature. They achieved this using \u201cthin films made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials,\u201d which the researchers claim allows for the formation of polarons. They also suggest that these polarons might absorb the thermal shocks that typically disrupt dipole synchronization at warmer temperatures. Thus, based on the text, Biliroglu and colleagues believe that polarons help dipoles synchronize at temperatures well above those at which superfluorescence had previously been observed. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address the prospect of a superfluorescent burst moving between crystalline materials or any other mediums. Choice C is incorrect because the text\u2019s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. Rather than suggesting that polarons speed up superfluorescent bursts, the text suggests that no superfluorescence can occur at room temperature in the absence of polarons. Thus, the text indicates that polarons make superfluorescent bursts more likely to occur at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed, not that polarons accelerate the bursts. Choice D is incorrect because the text\u2019s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. In the absence of polarons, the text suggests there would be no superfluorescence at room temperature. Thus, rather than decrease the intensity of superfluorescent bursts, polarons make them more likely to occur under certain circumstances.",

The text goes on to say that while it is \u201cnot inconceivable that Beowulf emerged from such a context\u201d\u2014that is, it is possible that Beowulf was composed during the late ninth through eleventh centuries\u2014there is linguistic evidence that the poem was composed earlier, in the seventh or eighth century.

    "question": "According to the text, why would a helicopter built for Earth be unable to fly on Mars?",
    "passage": "In 2014, Amelia Quon and her team at NASA set out to build a helicopter capable of flying on Mars. Because Mars\u2019s atmosphere is only one percent as dense as Earth\u2019s, the air of Mars would not provide enough resistance to the rotating blades of a standard helicopter for the aircraft to stay aloft. For five years, Quon\u2019s team tested designs in a lab that mimicked Mars\u2019s atmospheric conditions. The craft the team ultimately designed can fly on Mars because its blades are longer and rotate faster than those of a helicopter of the same size built for Earth.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Because Mars and Earth have different atmospheric conditions",
      "B) Because the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars",

      "D) Because helicopters built for Earth are too small to handle the conditions on Mars"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation about a helicopter that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Mars\u2019s atmosphere is much less dense than Earth\u2019s, and as a result, the air on Mars doesn\u2019t provide the resistance required to support the blades of a helicopter built for Earth and to keep the helicopter aloft. In other words, a helicopter built for Earth can\u2019t fly on Mars because of the differences in the two planets\u2019 atmospheres. Choice B is incorrect because instead of stating that the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars, the text indicates that the helicopter built to fly on Mars actually has even longer blades than a helicopter built for Earth. Choice C is incorrect because the text never addresses the role of gravity on Mars or on Earth; instead, it focuses on atmospheric conditions. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that helicopters built for Earth are too small to operate in the conditions on Mars. In fact, the text states that the size of the helicopter built to fly on Mars is the same size as a helicopter built for Earth, even though it has longer blades that rotate faster.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text indicates that dog owners typically claim that some dog breeds are \u201cmore likely than others to have particular personality traits.\u201d In other words, the text points out that a commonly held belief about dog breeds is that their personality traits are heritable. The text then states that Kathleen Morrill and colleagues undertook research about dog trait heritability and found that \u201cbehavior varies widely among dogs of the same breed.\u201d Because Morrill and colleagues found evidence for variability rather than consistency in the behavior of dogs of the same breed, the statement that research fails to uphold a commonly held belief about dog breeds and behavior accurately reflects the main idea of the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that humans have long intervened in dogs\u2019 reproduction by intentionally crossbreeding certain dogs, it doesn\u2019t argue that such intervention is essential to the existence of dog breeds.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss the popularity of any dog breeds; breeds are mentioned as having certain traits, but the text says nothing about the popularity of these breeds or traits. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text briefly mentions that Morrill and colleagues conducted a study about dog traits using both surveys and DNA sequencing, this is not the main focus of the text.

The text explains that up until Wang and his team\u2019s discovery, the only fossil evidence of mixopterids came from the paleocontinent of Laurussia. Wang and his team, however, identified fossil remains of a mixopterid species from the paleocontinent Gondwana. Therefore, the team\u2019s discovery was significant because the fossil remains of a mixopterid species were outside of the paleocontinent Laurussia. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that Wang and his team identified fossilized remains of a mixopterid species that lived more than 400 million years ago, it doesn\u2019t indicate that mixopterid fossils previously found by scientists dated to a more recent period than that. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that mixopterids are related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the fossil discovered by Wang and his team confirmed that this relationship is closer than scientists had previously thought.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the team\u2019s fossil established the presence of mixopterids on Gondwana, not on Laurussia.

The text goes on to say that in most Native communities, the art forms of beadwork and dressmaking are traditionally practiced by women. Therefore, Gibson\u2019s approach to art consists of creating original works by drawing from traditional Native art forms. Choice B is incorrect.

All but one of the 20 moons are thought to be remnants of bodies that orbited Saturn until they broke apart in collisions.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the moon with the eccentric orbit. The text indicates that three of the 20 newly discovered moons have prograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, while the other 17 moons have retrograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the opposite direction of the planet\u2019s spin. The text then states that 19 of the 20 moons appear to be the remains of earlier bodies that orbited Saturn but were broken apart in collisions. The one exception is a moon that orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, meaning that the exceptional moon\u2019s orbit is prograde. The text goes on to state that the exceptional moon\u2019s orbit is so eccentric that the moon may have formed through a different process than the other 19 moons. The moon with the eccentric orbit, therefore, has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text supports the idea that the moon with the eccentric orbit likely has the same origin as the moons with retrograde orbits. Although it\u2019s true that the moon has a prograde orbit (and thus doesn\u2019t have a retrograde orbit), the only information the text provides about the moon\u2019s origin is that it may be different than the origin of the other 19 moons. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the moon in question orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, meaning that the moon\u2019s orbit is prograde, not that its orbit is neither prograde nor retrograde.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, thousands of ceramic bowls were found in a recovered Chinese shipwreck. The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls\u2019 chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had produced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls\u2019 origin. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the researchers used technology in the form of a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, it doesn\u2019t specifically state that this technology is new. In addition, the text says that Niziolek and her team used the tool to determine the chemical composition of bowls that were found in a Chinese shipwreck, not to locate and recover the shipwreck itself. There\u2019s no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers collected materials from old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the ceramic bowls, which means that the researchers must have already known the location of those kiln sites. Rather than identifying the location of the kilns, the researchers determined which kilns in operation 1,000 years ago had likely produced the bowls that were found in the shipwreck.\n\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although the text says that using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool enabled Niziolek and her team to analyze artifacts in the form of ceramic bowls without damaging them, the text doesn\u2019t discuss how researchers analyzed artifacts before this tool was invented. Moreover, the point that the bowls were left undamaged isn\u2019t the text\u2019s main idea. Rather, it\u2019s a detail that\u2019s provided to develop the main idea, which is that the researchers used a special tool to determine where the bowls had been produced.",

      "D) It clarified that microorganism activity levels in the plant-soil cores varied depending on which microorganisms comprised the community."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes why the finding about the microorganism community composition was important. The text describes an experiment by Eva Ka\u0161tovsk\u00e1 and her team in which they collected plant-soil cores at one elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer. Ka\u0161tovsk\u00e1 and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that \"crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged,\" which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn\u2019t have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted cores, this is unrelated to what\u2019s important about the finding that the microorganism composition didn\u2019t change\u2014that it allowed the team to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text compares activity in one core at two different elevations, the text doesn\u2019t address changes in activity at various elevations over time. Choice D is incorrect. Although different microorganisms likely exhibit different levels of activity, the text indicates that there was no change in microorganism composition, and there is nothing in the text about different microorganisms having different activity levels.",

In the film*The Godfather Part II*, the*fabula *is the story of the Corleone family, and the*syuzhet *is the presentation of the story as it alternates between two timelines in 1901 and 1958. But literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin maintained that*fabula *and*syuzhet *are insufficient to completely describe a narrative\u2014he held that systematic categorizations of artistic phenomena discount the subtle way in which meaning is created by interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience.",

      "D) Narratives that are told out of chronological order are more difficult for audiences to understand than are narratives presented chronologically."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by explaining that many literary theorists rely on the concepts of fabula (a narrative\u2019s content) and syuzhet (a narrative\u2019s arrangement and presentation of events) and illustrates these concepts by explaining how they can be applied to the film The Godfather Part II. The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that fabula and syuzhet can\u2019t fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning. Thus, the main idea is that Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives. Choice B is incorrect because according to the text, Mikhail Bakhtin believed that meaning was created through the interactions of the artist, narrative, and audience, not simply through the interaction between the audience and narrative; moreover, the text doesn\u2019t address whether Bakhtin focused on the ways in which different people interpret narratives differently. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that the storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II are complicated, it discusses the film only to illustrate how the concepts of fabula and syuzhet may be applied to a narrative. The film\u2019s storytelling methods aren\u2019t the primary focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses The Godfather Part II, whose narrative doesn\u2019t adhere to a single chronological order, only to illustrate the concepts of fabula (a narrative\u2019s content) and syuzhet (a narrative\u2019s arrangement and presentation of events). The primary focus of this text isn\u2019t the structure of this film or of other narratives that are told out of chronological order; moreover, the text doesn\u2019t consider whether such structures make it harder for audiences to understand narratives.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the most likely consequence if New had not begun using sewing machines. The text states that New gained new customers and that sewing machines allowed him to make bags more efficiently, or in less time than he could when sewing by hand. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that if New hadn\u2019t reduced the time it took to make each bag by starting to use sewing machines, it would have been hard for him to keep up with the increased demand. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that New added unique, handcrafted details to his bags before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that individually designing each bag would have been a consequence of not using sewing machines, since New was already designing unique details for each bag before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that people were already interested in New\u2019s bags before he started using sewing machines.

    "choices": [
      "A) Although it may seem surprising that foreign investment declines in developing countries as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of those countries\u2019 economies, that decline happens because resource extraction requires initial investments too large for foreign investors to supply.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid. Choice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself.",

The text then goes on to suggest that this is because the way a dog experiences time differs from the way humans experience time: time for a dog doesn\u2019t move linearly, going \"on and on, from one thing to the next,\" but instead moves circularly, \"like the hands of a clock.\" That is, time for a dog is experienced as a cyclical pattern characterized by routine and predictability, with each day \"following the same path.\" The text then concludes by providing examples of seemingly insignificant changes in routine that profoundly \"disturbed [Karenin\u2019s] sense of time,\" causing him to feel displeasure. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Karenin\u2019s sense of time as a dog involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes Karenin\u2019s displeasure with the recent move to a new home, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the move has made his negative responses more pronounced than they once were. Rather, in accounting for Karenin\u2019s displeasure with the move to Switzerland, the text explains that Karenin generally has a negative response to any kind of change. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Karenin comprehends time similarly to how Tomas and Tereza comprehend it. On the contrary, the text strongly implies a contrast between dogs\u2019 circular experience of time with the way humans experience time as a straightforward progression that can be \"plotted on a straight line.\" Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no indication that a change in the places and objects surrounding Karenin causes him to feel as though time is accelerating. Although the text does use the language of \"dash[ing] madly ahead\" in relation to time, the phrase appears in the context of a comparison illustrating how dogs experience time: time for a dog moves just as the hands of a clock do, in a circle and \"unwilling to dash madly ahead\"\u2014that is, always in a regular and predictable way.",

    "passage": "Since its completion in 2014, Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest)\u2014a pair of residential towers in Milan, Italy, covered by vegetation\u2014has become a striking symbol of environmental sustainability in architecture. Stefano Boeri intended his design, which features balconies that are home to hundreds of trees, to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. However, the concept has faced skepticism: critics note that although the trees used in Bosco Verticale were specifically cultivated for the project, it\u2019s too early to tell if they can thrive in this unusual setting.",

      "D) It is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about critics\u2019 skepticism of Bosco Verticale that is supported by the text. The text states that Boeri\u2019s design for Bosco Verticale features hundreds of trees on balconies and is intended to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. But the text goes on to state that some critics believe that it is too early to determine if the trees planted on Bosco Verticale can thrive there. Therefore, according to the text, critics are skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale because it is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri\u2019s goals was for Bosco Verticale to serve as a model for promoting biodiversity in architecture, which suggests that Boeri would likely support the idea of reproducing the same concept in other locations, the text does not discuss whether it is feasible to adapt the design to locations other than Milan. Instead, the text describes critics\u2019 concerns that the plant life that currently exists on Bosco Verticale might not thrive in its current setting. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri\u2019s goals in creating Bosco Verticale was to promote biodiversity, which implies a goal of including varied plant life in the design, it does not mention whether the hundreds of trees that were planted on its balconies failed to meet this goal. Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale\u2019s balconies may not thrive in this setting. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not mention how Bosco Verticale was constructed, let alone how environmentally destructive its construction may have been relative to the construction of more conventional buildings.",

Researchers now claim that the ridges\u2019 formation mechanism mirrors that of a strikingly similar pair on Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. There, surface water seeped through fissures in the sheet and formed a water pocket that subsequently disrupted the overlying ice, forcing fragments of it upward and outward into peaks, as the pocket froze and expanded. Although Europa lacks liquid surface water, the same process could be driven by the moon\u2019s subsurface ocean.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. The text focuses on formations of parallel ice ridges on Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa that are said to be formed by the same mechanism that formed a parallel set of ridges on Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. The text indicates that in Greenland, water on the surface seeps to the lower portion of the ice sheet, resulting in uplift that creates the ridges, and it states that although Europa lacks liquid water on its surface, the same process could be driven by an ocean below Europa\u2019s surface. In other words, the main idea of the text is that parallel ridges in the ice on Europa and Greenland are likely caused by similar processes even though in Greenland the process begins with liquid water on the surface while Europa lacks liquid water on the surface. Choice B is incorrect because the text states outright that the ridges on Europa are parallel and furthermore refers to Greenland\u2019s ridges as \"strikingly similar\" to those on Europa. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of when any of the ice ridges formed, either separately or relative to one another. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not indicate any uncertainty about the reason for the ice ridges on Europa and, in fact, clearly states that researchers now claim to know the mechanism that created the ridges.",

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the point about the magnetic field mapping that the text describes as surprising. The text indicates that a team of astronomers mapped the magnetic field of G47, a galactic bone in the Milky Way, and that the mapping \"surprisingly\" revealed \"no clear pattern or direction\" in the magnetic field. The text then adds that the researchers had thought the magnetic field would be as uniform as the magnetic fields of other galactic bones in the Milky Way are.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it states a conclusion the researchers likely agree with, given the details in the text. The text explains that a biosignature gas is a gas that can be used as an indicator that a planet harbors some form of life and some astronomers have proposed that NH3 could serve as a biosignature gas. The researchers evaluating this claim found that the atmosphere of rocky planets would be unlikely to reach \"detectably high levels\" of NH3 without biological activity, which would support the proposal of NH3 serving as a biosignature gas. However, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can produce NH3 in the absence of biological activity. Thus, the text is structured to lead to the conclusion that detectable levels of NH3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets could constitute a biosignature, but that is not the case for detectable levels of the gas in the atmospheres of mini-Neptune planets. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that biological activity likely accounts for detectable levels of NH3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets but mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of NH3 in their atmospheres in the absence of biological activity. Therefore, both rocky planets and mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of atmospheric NH3. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that for NH3 to reach detectable levels in the atmospheres of rocky planets likely means they harbor biological activity, meaning that rocky planets with detectable NH3 usually harbor biological activity. However, that does not entail that every rocky planet with biological activity will have detectable levels of NH3 in their atmospheres. Choice D is incorrect because the text claims only that some astronomers have proposed using NH3 as a biosignature gas without mentioning a minimum concentration of atmospheric NH3 that must be met for it to function as a biosignature gas.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about surfactants that is supported by the text. The text indicates that higher concentrations of microplastics have been associated with waves that are relatively small and few. According to the text, however, a study by Sun and colleagues found that concentrations of microplastic particles can\u2019t be the only reason for the reduced wave activity because a much higher concentration of particles is needed to produce that observed effect. Instead, the text indicates that Sun and colleagues found that surfactants are released from microplastics into the ocean and have a much stronger wave-reducing effect than microplastics alone do. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss what surfactants are made of. Instead, it indicates that surfactants are frequently used to manufacture microplastics and that Sun and colleagues discovered that surfactants are released from microplastics into the ocean. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss how microplastics can be removed from the ocean. Instead, the text indicates that Sun and colleagues discovered that surfactants are released into the ocean from microplastics and have a much stronger wave-reducing effect than microplastics alone do. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that surfactants can be used to contain microplastics within certain areas of the ocean. Instead, the text indicates that Sun and colleagues discovered that surfactants are released from microplastics into the ocean and have a much stronger wave-reducing effect than microplastics alone do.",

    "passage": "Artificial leaves are a developing renewable energy technology that mimics the process of photosynthesis in plants. These devices are silicon-based solar cells coated in chemical catalysts that activate reactions that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gas. The technology, while generating lots of interest, is not yet commercially viable as a large-scale energy source. To meet this challenge, scientists from many fields are researching ways to store, transport, and distribute the energy the devices produce while other scientists are working to improve the cost and efficiency of the devices.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Continued research and development in artificial-leaf technology is needed before the devices can be widely used as an energy source.",
      "B) The recent increase in the commercial use of artificial leaves as an energy source has encouraged many scientists to research ways to improve the technology.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, artificial leaves are a renewable energy technology that\u2019s in development and generating interest. The text goes on to state that artificial-leaf technology \"is not yet commercially viable as a large-scale energy source\" and that scientists from several fields are doing additional research to refine the technology. Thus, the main idea is that continued research and development in artificial-leaf technology is needed before the devices can be widely used as an energy source. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that scientists from many fields are researching artificial leaves, they\u2019re doing so to address the fact that the leaves are not yet commercially viable, rather than in response to an increase in commercial use. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does explain that artificial leaves help split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas using catalysts, it doesn\u2019t argue that this process is more efficient than photosynthesis. This is merely a detail of the text and not the main idea, which is about the additional research needed to improve the cost and efficiency of these artificial leaves. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that artificial leaves mimic photosynthesis in plants, this is an incidental detail in support of the main idea that additional research is needed to make artificial leaves commercially viable.",

    "passage": "Recently, scientists looked at data collected by NASA\u2019s InSight lander to learn more about seismic activity on Mars, known as marsquakes. The data show that the marsquakes all started from the same location on the planet. This discovery was surprising to scientists, as they expected that the marsquakes would originate from all over the planet because of the cooling of the planet\u2019s surface. Now, scientists believe that there could be areas of active magma flows deep beneath the planet\u2019s surface that trigger the marsquakes.",

      "D) All the marsquakes started from the same location on the planet."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about what surprised the scientists that is supported by the text. The text states that the marsquakes described in the data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander originated from the same location on Mars. The text goes on to say that because they had expected the opposite (that marsquakes would originate from all over the planet) this discovery surprised the scientists. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t say that the data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander revealed any surprising information about the planet\u2019s surface temperature. Instead, the text mentions the cooling of Mars\u2019s surface as a reason the scientists expected that marsquakes had multiple origins. In addition, cooling would indicate that the temperature has been falling rather than rising. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that by studying seismic activity scientists found a possible explanation for what causes marsquakes, the text doesn\u2019t say that they discovered that marsquakes are caused by different types of seismic waves. Rather, the text states that based on the data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander, scientists now believe that this seismic activity happens because of areas of active magma that flow below the planet\u2019s surface. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss the amount of data NASA\u2019s InSight lander collected or whether scientists who studied the data found the amount to be as expected.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a description of how Zerviah Holme felt that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Holme \"did not like to be interrupted\" while reading Gibbon and that he considered interruptions to be \"an insult.\" Furthermore, the text suggests that Gibbon is Holme\u2019s favorite author because, as the text states, \"he was always reading Gibbon.\" Thus, Holme would have felt annoyed at having been interrupted when the letter was delivered. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Holme is relieved to receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme \"just glanced indifferently at the letter,\" suggesting that the letter wasn\u2019t important to him. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Holme is excited to receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme didn\u2019t put down his book to receive the letter and that he looked at the letter \"indifferently\" and at the postman \"impatiently.\" This suggests that Holme isn\u2019t excited. Also, there is no mention that Holme knows who sent the letter. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Holme is sad or that he wants to speak with the postman.

Davis focuses on how Rainey and Smith improvised the lyrics\u2014replacing the original lines with mischievous jokes and wordplay. Davis\u2019s work was particularly labor intensive because in order to transcribe, or write down, the lyrics as Rainey and Smith sang them, Davis had to listen repeatedly to the vinyl recordings, which weren\u2019t very clear.",

      "A) The songs have grown in popularity since Rainey and Smith first sang them.",

      "D) According to Davis, the songs sung by Rainey were more musically innovative than those sung by Smith typically were."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it describes the songs sung by Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey and Bessie Smith in a way the text implies is accurate. The text describes Angela Y. Davis\u2019s research on Rainey and Smith for her book Blues Legacies and Black Feminism, focusing on her efforts to transcribe the improvised lyrics in Rainey\u2019s and Smith\u2019s songs. The text calls Davis\u2019s transcription process \"labor intensive\" since the lack of clarity in the recordings required her to listen to each repeatedly to verify the accuracy of her transcripts. The fact that Davis undertook a painstaking transcription process using only fairly low-fidelity recordings suggests that reliable transcriptions were otherwise unavailable to her. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn\u2019t discuss the popularity of Rainey\u2019s and Smith\u2019s songs either in the 1920s or after. Although it is plausible that the music of Rainey and Smith is more widely enjoyed than it was in the 1920s, this isn\u2019t supported by the text. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn\u2019t discuss which of Rainey and Smith was the more prolific recording artist and so provides no support for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the creativity of both Rainey and Smith, but it does so only to note similarities between them in terms of improvisation and wit, not to emphasize differences between them or Davis\u2019s relative views of the artists\u2019 inventiveness.",

It also shows that in 2010, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 120) was substantially higher than the value for uncertainty about trade policy (approximately 70). The substantial differences between these values in 2005 and 2010 support the claim that a general measure may not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of policy.

    "question": "Which choice best describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion?",
    "passage": "The Jordanelle Dam was built on the Provo River in Utah in 1992. Earth scientist Adriana E. Martinez and colleagues tracked changes to the environment on the banks of the river downstream of the dam, including how much grass and forest cover were present. They concluded that the dam changed the flow of the river in ways that benefited grass plants but didn\u2019t benefit trees.",
    "choices": [
      "A) The lowest amount of grass cover was approximately 58,000 square meters, and the highest amount of forest cover was approximately 75,000 square meters.",
      "B) There was more grass cover than forest cover in 1987, and this difference increased dramatically in 1993 and again in 2006.",
      "C) There was less grass cover than bare soil in 1987 but more grass cover than bare soil in 1993 and 2006, whereas there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years.",
      "D) Grass cover increased from 1987 to 1993 and from 1993 to 2006, whereas forest cover decreased in those periods."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the Jordanelle Dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years\u20141987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees\u2014grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined. Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn\u2019t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees.",

    "passage": "Geographer Adebayo Oluwole Eludoyin and his colleagues surveyed small-scale farmers in three locations in Ondo State, Nigeria\u2014which has mountainous terrain in the north, an urbanized center, and coastal terrain in the south\u2014to learn more about their practices, like the types of crops they mainly cultivated. In some regions, female farmers were found to be especially prominent in the cultivation of specific types of crops and even constituted the majority of farmers who cultivated those crops; for instance,______blank",
    "choices": [
      "A) most of the farmers who mainly cultivated cereals and most of the farmers who mainly cultivated non\u2013root vegetables in south Ondo were women.",
      "B) more women in central Ondo mainly cultivated root crops than mainly cultivated cereals.",
      "C) most of the farmers who mainly cultivated non\u2013root vegetables in north and south Ondo were women.",
      "D) a relatively equal proportion of women across the three regions of Ondo mainly cultivated cereals."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively complete the example of Eludoyin and his colleagues\u2019 findings concerning female farmers in some regions of Ondo State, Nigeria. The graph presents values for the percentage of Ondo State small-scale farmers who are female, by type of crop and region. The graph shows that of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables, approximately 57% in north Ondo and approximately 54% in south Ondo are female; in other words, most of those farmers are female, which exemplifies the idea that female farmers make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating specific types of crops in some regions. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that in south Ondo, most of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables are women (approximately 54%), but that only about 35% (less than half) of the farmers mainly cultivating cereals are women. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that more women in central Ondo mainly cultivate cereals than mainly cultivate root crops (approximately 36% and 20%, respectively). Additionally, it doesn\u2019t effectively complete the example because the graph shows that female farmers don\u2019t make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers for any type of crop in central Ondo. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t effectively complete the example; it simply states that a relatively equal proportion of women across the three regions mainly cultivate cereals, which doesn\u2019t address the value for that proportion and thus doesn\u2019t show that a majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating certain crops are female.",

    "passage": "While attending school in New York City in the 1980s, Okwui Enwezor encountered few works by African artists in exhibitions, despite New York\u2019s reputation as one of the best places to view contemporary art from around the world. According to an arts journalist, later in his career as a renowned curator and art historian, Enwezor sought to remedy this deficiency, not by focusing solely on modern African artists, but by showing how their work fits into the larger context of global modern art and art history.",
    "choices": [
      "A) As curator of the Haus der Kunst in Munich, Germany, Enwezor organized a retrospective of Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui\u2019s work entitled El Anatsui: Triumphant Scale, one of the largest art exhibitions devoted to a Black artist in Europe\u2019s history.",
      "B) In the exhibition Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945\u20131965, Enwezor and cocurator Katy Siegel brought works by African artists such as Malangatana Ngwenya together with pieces by major figures from other countries, like US artist Andy Warhol and Mexico\u2019s David Siqueiros.",
      "C) Enwezor\u2019s work as curator of the 2001 exhibition The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945\u20131994 showed how African movements for independence from European colonial powers following the Second World War profoundly influenced work by African artists of the period, such as Kamala Ibrahim Ishaq and Thomas Mukarobgwa.",
      "D) Enwezor organized the exhibition In/sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present not to emphasize a particular aesthetic trend but to demonstrate the broad range of ways in which African artists have approached the medium of photography."

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the arts journalist\u2019s claim about Enwezor\u2019s work as a curator and art historian. In the text, the arts journalist asserts that Enwezor wished not just to focus on modern African artists but also to show \u201chow their work fits into the larger context of global modern art and art history,\u201d or how their work relates to artistic developments and work by other artists elsewhere in the world. The description of Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945\u20131965 indicates that Enwezor and Siegel\u2019s exhibition brought works by African artists together with works by artists from other countries, thus supporting the arts journalist\u2019s claim that Enwezor sought to show works by African artists in a context of global modern art and art history. Choice A is incorrect because it describes a retrospective that wouldn\u2019t support the arts journalist\u2019s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists fit into the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of El Anatsui: Triumphant Scale indicates that the retrospective focused only on the work of a single African artist, El Anatsui. The description doesn\u2019t suggest that the exhibition showed how El Anatsui\u2019s works fit into a global artistic context. Choice C is incorrect because it describes an exhibition that wouldn\u2019t support the arts journalist\u2019s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists relate to the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945\u20131994 indicates that the exhibition showed how African artists were influenced by movements for independence from European colonial powers following the Second World War. Although this suggests that Enwezor intended the exhibition to place works by African artists in a political context, it doesn\u2019t indicate that the works were placed in a global artistic context. Choice D is incorrect because it describes an exhibition that wouldn\u2019t support the arts journalist\u2019s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists relate to the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of In/sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present indicates that the exhibition was intended to reveal the broad range of approaches taken by African photographers, not that the exhibition showed how photography by African artists fits into a global artistic context.",

The quotation presents the image of the moon shining on a body of water. However, instead of describing the moon in passive terms or simply stating that it reflects through the water and onto the sandy shore, the quotation portrays the moon as being engaged in the humanlike action of writing a legend. In other words, the moon is participating actively in the nighttime scene. Choice B is incorrect. Although the quotation describes a nighttime scene on a body of water, the element of nature in these lines\u2014the waves\u2014isn\u2019t portrayed as an active participant in an experience; instead, the waves merely ripple softly against a canoe, as waves would normally do.

Lynn Harrell Jr. examined oxygen-18 isotopes in mosasaur tooth enamel in order to calculate likely mosasaur body temperatures and determined that mosasaurs were endothermic\u2014that is, they used internal metabolic processes to maintain a stable body temperature in a variety of ambient temperatures. Suarez, P\u00e9rez-Huerta, and Harrell claim that endothermy would have enabled mosasaurs to include relatively cold polar waters in their range.",

      "D) During the Late Cretaceous, seawater temperatures were likely higher throughout mosasaurs\u2019 range, including near the poles, than seawater temperatures at those same latitudes are today."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the finding that, if true, would best support Suarez, P\u00e9rez-Huerta, and Harrell\u2019s claim about mosasaurs. The text states that Suarez, P\u00e9rez-Huerta, and Harrell\u2019s research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers\u2019 claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range. Choice A is incorrect because finding that it\u2019s easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 claim. Whether one research process is more difficult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations.\u00a0\n\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because finding roughly equal numbers of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest that endothermy didn\u2019t give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers\u2019 claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because finding that the temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn\u2019t weaken the researchers\u2019 claim. Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be advantageous to mosasaurs, so this finding wouldn\u2019t provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers\u2019 claim.",

    "passage": "A student is examining a long, challenging poem that was initially published in a quarterly journal without explanatory notes, then later republished in a stand-alone volume containing only that poem and accompanying explanatory notes written by the poet.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it would most directly support the student\u2019s claim about the motivation for including explanatory notes with the stand-alone volume of the poem. The text explains that the poem had previously been published without the notes in a quarterly journal. It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the author\u2019s own explanation of the poem. Therefore, if it were true that the publishers of the stand-alone volume had requested the notes to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy of the journal issue, this fact would support the student\u2019s claim that the notes were included primarily as a marketing device. Choice A is incorrect because\u00a0the student\u2019s claim is about the motivation for including the explanatory notes in the stand-alone volume, not about changes that might have been made to the poem itself for publication in that volume; moreover, the text never suggests that such changes were made. Choice B is incorrect because the student\u2019s claim is about why the explanatory notes were included in the stand-alone volume, not about how the notes affected readers\u2019 and critics\u2019 subsequent experience of the poem. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that the poet drafted multiple versions of the explanatory notes doesn\u2019t directly address the issue of whether the notes were intended as a marketing device, as the student claims; the correspondence would support this claim only if it showed that the poet had revised the notes specifically to make them useful to the marketing of the stand-alone volume.",

If participants who saw a panel of three commentators with various views about an issue answered more questions about the issue correctly than did participants who saw a debate, that would support Tannen\u2019s hypothesis since it would show that participants who heard multiple varied perspectives were better informed than were participants who heard a debate between opposing viewpoints. Choice A is incorrect because finding that participants perceived commentators in the debate as more knowledgeable than commentators in the panel is irrelevant to Tannen\u2019s hypothesis, which is that presenting multiple perspectives on an issue is more informative to the audience than presenting opposing views of the issue is.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the researchers\u2019 conclusion about the harvesting of clamshells by Neanderthals for use as tools. The text explains that Neanderthals used clamshells to make tools and that the sturdiest, and therefore the most desirable, shells for this purpose are found on the seafloor, not on the beach. However, the researchers also concluded that the clamshell tools made from shells from the seafloor are rarer than those made from shells from the beach. Meanwhile the table shows that at each depth, the number of tools made from shells from the beach exceeds the number made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. The fact that the more desirable shells are less common suggests that it was significantly more difficult to harvest shells from the seafloor than from the beach. Choice B is incorrect because knowing which depth represents the period of time with the highest Neanderthal population does not help answer the question of why the Neanderthals consistently made more tools from the less desirable shells from the beach than they made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. Choice C is incorrect because it claims that the beach shells are more durable than the seafloor shells, which contradicts the text\u2019s description of shells from the seafloor as smoother and sturdier than shells from the beach.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most directly illustrates the claim that Whitman\u2019s poem suggests that its readers haven\u2019t fully understood themselves. This quotation makes that point directly by saying to readers, \u201cYou have not known what you are.\u201d The quotation goes on to reinforce this point using a metaphor of sleep, saying that readers have \u201cslumber\u2019d\u201d and that their \u201ceyelids have been the same as closed most of the time.\u201d Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn\u2019t suggest that readers haven\u2019t fully understood themselves but instead characterizes readers as \u201cimmense\u201d and \u201cinterminable.\u201d Although immense and interminable things can be difficult to understand, this quotation doesn\u2019t make that point.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because this quotation doesn\u2019t suggest that readers haven\u2019t fully understood themselves but instead conveys the speaker\u2019s regret over not having celebrated readers sooner. In fact, this quotation says nothing at all about readers themselves\u2014it\u2019s focused solely on the speaker\u2019s feelings about readers.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because this quotation doesn\u2019t suggest that readers haven\u2019t fully understood themselves; instead, this quotation makes the point that the speaker has understood readers and is determined to create \u201chymns\u201d about them.",

    "passage": "Considering a large sample of companies, economics experts Maria Guadalupe, Julie Wulf, and Raghuram Rajan assessed the number of managers and leaders from different departments who reported directly to a chief executive officer (CEO). According to the researchers, the findings suggest that across the years analyzed, there was a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies.",

      "B) The average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 1996\u20132001 period.",

      "D) The average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that there is a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies. The graph shows the average number of individuals reporting directly to CEOs during three different time periods: the individuals are divided into managers and department leaders. The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991\u20131995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996\u20132001 period it was four, and during the 2001\u20132008 period it was almost seven. Thus, the average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied, which suggests that CEOs were connecting with more departments. Choice A is incorrect because the average number of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose for both categories between the 1991\u20131995 and 2001\u20132008 periods; thus, it isn\u2019t true that the average numbers didn\u2019t fluctuate. Choice B is incorrect because the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 2001\u20132008 period, not in the 1996\u20132001 period. Choice C is incorrect. Although it correctly describes a feature of the graph, the observation that more department leaders than managers are reporting to CEOs does not by itself address the question of whether CEOs are connecting with more departments over time\u2014to address that question, one needs to know whether the number of department leaders reporting to CEOs is increasing over time.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros\u2019s The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros\u2019s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character\u2019s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood. Choice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn\u2019t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren\u2019t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella\u2019s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren\u2019t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that The House on Mango Street has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn\u2019t relate directly to the text\u2019s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros\u2019s The House on Mango Street would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros\u2019s novella, such similarities wouldn\u2019t necessarily be evidence of the novella\u2019s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how The House on Mango Street had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella\u2019s influence.",

    "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers\u2019 conclusion?",
    "passage": "Rivers rich in sediment appear yellow, while increases in red algae make rivers appear red. To track things like the sediment or algae content of large US rivers, John R. Gardner and colleagues used satellite data to determine the dominant visible wavelengths of light measured for various segments of these rivers. The researchers classified wavelengths of 495 nanometers (nm) and below as red, wavelengths between 495 and 560 nm as blue, and wavelengths of 560 nm and above as yellow. The researchers concluded that for the Missouri River, segments flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than those flowing out of lakes.",
    "choices": [
      "A) The segments of the Missouri River that had higher levels of chlorophyll-a, which contributes to the green color of photosynthetic organisms, have dominant wavelengths of light between 490 and 560 nm.",
      "B) In lakes through which segments of the Missouri River pass, the dominant wavelength of light tended to be above 560 nm near the lakes\u2019 shores and below 560 nm in the lakes\u2019 centers.",
      "C) The majority of the segments of the Missouri River were found to have dominant wavelengths of light significantly higher than 560 nm.",
      "D) Segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes typically had dominant wavelengths of light above 560 nm, while segments flowing out of lakes typically had dominant wavelengths below 560 nm."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river flowing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues\u2019 conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes. Choice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers\u2019 conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes. This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. This finding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers\u2019 conclusion about river segments flowing into and out of lakes.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. Only a comparison of river segments flowing into lakes with segments flowing out of lakes can support the researchers\u2019 conclusion.",

The text states that over the last two hundred years employment in the agricultural sector has declined while employment in the service sector has risen in both France and the US, and the data from the table reflect these trends. The text asserts, however, that the transition from agriculture to services \u201chappened at very different rates in the two countries.\u201d This assertion is best supported by a comparison of data from 1900 and 1950: the table shows that in those years, employment in agriculture went from 43% to 32% in France (a decline of 11 percentage points) and from 41% to 14% in the US (a decline of 27 percentage points), and that employment in services went from 28% to 35% in France (an increase of 7 percentage points) and from 31% to 53% in the US (an increase of 22 percentage points). In other words, the rate of change was greater in the US than in France for both sectors.

    "passage": "Archaeologist Petra Vaiglova, anthropologist Xinyi Liu, and their colleagues investigated the domestication of farm animals in China during the Bronze Age (approximately 2000 to 1000 BCE). By analyzing the chemical composition of the bones of sheep, goats, and cattle from this era, the team determined that wild plants made up the bulk of sheep\u2019s and goats\u2019 diets, while the cattle\u2019s diet consisted largely of millet, a crop cultivated by humans. The team concluded that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements, whereas sheep and goats were allowed to roam farther away.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the team\u2019s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. The text explains that Vaiglova, Liu, and their colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of sheep, goat, and cattle bones from the Bronze Age in China in order to investigate the animals\u2019 domestication, or their adaptation from a wild state to a state in which they existed in close connection with humans. According to the text, the team\u2019s analysis showed that sheep and goats of the era fed largely on wild plants, whereas cattle fed on millet\u2014importantly, a crop cultivated by humans. If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle\u2019s diet also consisted of wheat, another crop cultivated by humans in China during the Bronze Age, the finding would support the team\u2019s conclusion by offering additional evidence that cattle during this era fed on human-grown crops\u2014and, by extension, that humans raised cattle relatively close to the settlements where they grew these crops, leaving goats and sheep to roam farther away in areas with wild vegetation, uncultivated by humans. Choice B is incorrect because if it were true that sheep\u2019s and goats\u2019 diets consisted of small portions of millet, which the text states was a crop cultivated by humans, the finding would suggest that sheep and goats were raised relatively close to human settlements, weakening the team\u2019s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to those settlements than sheep and goats were. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that cattle generally require more food and nutrients than do sheep and goats wouldn\u2019t support the team\u2019s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. Nothing in the text suggests that cattle were incapable of obtaining sufficient food and nutrients without access to human-grown crops. Hence, even if cattle\u2019s diets are found to have different requirements than the diets of sheep and goats, the cattle could have met those requirements from food located far from human settlements.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because if it were true that the diets of sheep, goats, and cattle varied based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow, the finding would weaken the team\u2019s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were, suggesting instead that all three types of animals were raised close enough to human settlements to feed on those settlements\u2019 crops.",

    "question": "Which choice best describes data from the graph that weaken the student\u2019s conclusion?",
    "passage": "To investigate the effect of lizard predation on spider populations, a student in a biology class placed spiders in two enclosures, one with lizards and one without, and tracked the number of spiders in the enclosures for 30 days. The student concluded that the reduction in the spider population count in the enclosure with lizards by day 30 was entirely attributable to the presence of the lizards.",
    "choices": [
      "A) The spider population count was the same in both enclosures on day 1.",
      "B) The spider population count also substantially declined by day 30 in the enclosure without lizards.",
      "C) The largest decline in spider population count in the enclosure with lizards occurred from day 1 to day 10.",
      "D) The spider population count on day 30 was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that weaken the student\u2019s conclusion about the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards. The graph shows that the enclosure with lizards and the enclosure without lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student\u2019s claim is that the reduction in spiders in the enclosure with lizards is \u201centirely attributable to the presence of the lizards,\u201d meaning that the spider population wouldn\u2019t have declined except for the presence of the lizards. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of spiders fell in the enclosure without lizards as well as in the enclosure with lizards, there must be some other factor than just the presence of the lizards that contributed to the reduction in the spider population. Choice A is incorrect because the fact that the two enclosures started with the same number of spiders is irrelevant to the claim that the reduction in spider population by day 30 in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the spider population in the enclosure with lizards fell more between days 1 and 10 than in other periods has nothing to do with the student\u2019s claim that the reduction in spiders in that enclosure by day 30 can be entirely attributed to the lizards.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although it\u2019s true that on day 30 the spider population was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards, this fact doesn\u2019t weaken the student\u2019s claim that the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Indeed, the lower spider population in the enclosure with lizards suggests that the lizards are contributing to the reduction in the spider population, though the fact that the spider population also fell substantially in the other enclosure means that the lizards aren\u2019t the only cause of the reduction.",

      "A) \u201cLumumba is a difficult figure to evaluate due to the starkly conflicting opinions he inspired during his life and continues to inspire today.\u201d",
      "B) \u201cThe available information makes it clear that Lumumba\u2019s political beliefs and values were largely consistent throughout his career.\u201d",
      "C) \u201cLumumba\u2019s practical accomplishments can be passed over quickly; it is mainly as the personification of Congolese independence that he warrants scholarly attention.\u201d",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it illustrates the student\u2019s claim about some historians viewing Lumumba primarily as a symbol. This quotation argues that Lumumba \u201cwarrants\u201d (or deserves) \u201cscholarly attention\u201d as a symbol and not for his \u201cpractical accomplishments\u201d\u2014that is, his actions as prime minister\u2014which \u201ccan be passed over quickly,\u201d or dismissed as being of comparatively little importance. Thus, the quotation expresses the view that the student criticizes some historians for holding. Choice A is incorrect. Although this quotation touches on the difficulty of evaluating Lumumba\u2019s legacy, it doesn\u2019t address how historians of modern African politics view him as a symbol. Choice B is incorrect. While this quotation mentions Lumumba\u2019s political beliefs, it doesn\u2019t discuss historians viewing him as a symbol. Choice D is incorrect.

    "question": "Which finding from the researchers\u2019 study, if true, would most strongly support their claim?",
    "passage": "Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe\u2014a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful\u2014can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the building.",
      "B) Participants who helped the experimenter pick up the pens used a greater number of positive words to describe the trees and the building in a postexperiment survey than did participants who did not help the experimenter.",
      "C) Participants who did not help the experimenter pick up the pens were significantly more likely to report having experienced a feeling of awe, regardless of whether they looked at the building or the trees.",
      "D) Participants who had been looking at the building were significantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants who had been looking at the trees."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the researchers\u2019 claim that they found evidence that experiencing awe can make people feel more connected to others and thus more likely to behave altruistically (with beneficial and unselfish concern for others). According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by first having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The finding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers\u2019 claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the researchers\u2019 claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. The text doesn\u2019t address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn\u2019t serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn\u2019t help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers\u2019 claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true\u2014that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the researchers\u2019 claim about people behaving altruistically. Being aware of a challenge or problem isn\u2019t necessarily beneficial on its own and isn\u2019t the same as offering help, so the finding wouldn\u2019t support the idea that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior.",

    "question": "Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Ayalew and her colleagues\u2019 hypothesis?",
    "passage": "Many plants lose their leaf color when exposed to kanamycin, an antibiotic produced by some soil microorganisms. Spelman College biologist Mentewab Ayalew and her colleagues hypothesized that plants\u2019 response to kanamycin exposure involves altering their uptake of metals, such as iron and zinc. The researchers grew two groups of seedlings of the plant*Arabidopsis**thaliana*, half of which were exposed to kanamycin and half of which were a control group without exposure to kanamycin, and measured the plants\u2019 metal content five days after germination.",
    "choices": [
      "A) The control plants contained higher levels of zinc than iron, but plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of iron than zinc.",
      "B) Both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc.",
      "C) Zinc levels were around 300 parts per million in the control plants but nearly 400 parts per million in the plants exposed to kanamycin.",
      "D) The plants exposed to kanamycin showed lower levels of iron and zinc than the control plants did."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data in the graph supporting Ayalew and her colleagues\u2019 hypothesis that plants\u2019 response to kanamycin exposure involves altering their uptake of metals. The graph compares the metal content of two groups of plants, one with kanamycin exposure and a control group without such exposure. The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million. Thus, the graph shows that plants with kanamycin exposure have significantly lower levels of both iron and zinc than the plants without kanamycin exposure. This is evidence supporting the hypothesis that kanamycin exposure results in plants altering their uptake of metals. Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that control plants contained higher levels of iron than zinc, not higher levels of zinc than iron; similarly, the plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of zinc than iron, not higher levels of iron than zinc. Choice B is incorrect. Though the claim that both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc is supported by the graph, this alone does not state whether plants with kanamycin exposure have a different metal content than plants without kanamycin exposure. Choice C is incorrect. The graph shows that the zinc levels for the control plants (those without kanamycin exposure) were around 400 parts per million, not 300 parts per million, and that the zinc levels for plants with kanamycin exposure were around 300 parts per million, not 400 parts per million.",

    "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the team\u2019s idea?",
    "passage": "Many insects are iridescent, or have colors that appear to shimmer and change when seen from different angles. Scientists have assumed that this feature helps to attract mates but could also attract predators. But biologist Karin Kjernsmo and a team had the idea that the shifting appearance of colors might actually make it harder for other animals to see iridescent insects. To test this idea, the team put beetle forewings on leaves along a forest path and then asked human participants to look for them. Some of the wings were naturally iridescent. Others were painted with a nonchanging color from the iridescent spectrum, such as purple or blue.",
    "choices": [
      "A) On average, participants found most of the purple wings and blue wings and far fewer of the iridescent wings.",
      "B) On average, participants found the iridescent wings faster than they found the purple wings or blue wings.",

      "D) Some participants successfully found all of the wings on the leaves."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the finding that, if true, would most strongly support the research team\u2019s idea about the effect of iridescence, or colors that appear to shimmer and change. The text indicates that although some scientists have assumed that iridescence could attract predators, Kjernsmo\u2019s team wondered if iridescent insects might be harder for other animals to see. The team tested this idea by asking human participants to look for both iridescent beetle wings and beetle wings that weren\u2019t iridescent but that had been painted colors such as purple or blue. If participants located most of the purple or blue wings but far fewer of the iridescent wings, that finding would support the team\u2019s idea since it would suggest that noniridescent wings are easier to see than iridescent wings. Choice B is incorrect because if participants located the iridescent wings more quickly than the purple or blue wings, that finding would weaken the team\u2019s idea, not support the team\u2019s idea, since it would suggest that the iridescent wings were easier to see than the noniridescent wings. Choice C is incorrect because finding that some participants believed that the purple wings were easier to see than the blue wings would be irrelevant to the team\u2019s idea. The purple and blue wings were both noniridescent, so any difference in how easy those two colors were to see would have nothing to do with the idea that iridescent insects are harder to see than noniridescent insects. Choice D is incorrect because if some participants found all the wings, that wouldn\u2019t support the team\u2019s idea that iridescent insects may be harder to see than noniridescent insects. If anything, this finding might weaken the team\u2019s idea since it could suggest that iridescence had no effect on how difficult the wings were to see.",

    "passage": "Icebergs generally appear to be mostly white or blue, depending on how the ice reflects sunlight. Ice with air bubbles trapped in it looks white because much of the light reflects off the bubbles. Ice without air bubbles usually looks blue because the light travels deep into the ice and only a little of it is reflected. However, some icebergs in the sea around Antarctica appear to be green. One team of scientists hypothesized that this phenomenon is the result of yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in Antarctic waters mixing with blue ice to produce the color green.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken the scientists\u2019 hypothesis about icebergs that appear to be green. The text indicates that most icebergs are either mostly white or blue in color but that some icebergs in Antarctica appear to be green. The text goes on to say that the scientists hypothesized that this green color occurs when yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in ocean waters mixes with blue ice. A finding that both blue icebergs and green icebergs contain similarly small traces of dissolved organic carbon would suggest that something other than yellow-tinted organic carbon causes some icebergs\u2019 green color, since the blue icebergs that contain yellow-tinted organic carbon remained blue instead of turning green. Choice A is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists\u2019 hypothesis was that blue icebergs, not white ones, change color when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon. A finding that white ice,\u00a0because of its air bubbles, doesn\u2019t change color when it\u2019s mixed with dissolved organic carbon would therefore have no bearing on the scientists\u2019 hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on Antarctic icebergs that appear to be green. It doesn\u2019t indicate that icebergs in locations other than Antarctica have been found to have a green hue. A finding that dissolved organic carbon has a stronger yellow color in Antarctic waters than in other places would therefore have no bearing on the scientists\u2019 hypothesis that green color in icebergs in Antarctica is caused by yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon mixing with blue ice. Choice C is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists\u2019 hypothesis was that blue icebergs turn green when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in the sea around them. If that\u2019s correct, one would expect blue icebergs and green icebergs to be located at a distance from each other since all blue icebergs in an area where the waters contain yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon would take on a green hue. A finding that blue icebergs and green icebergs are rarely found near each other would therefore strengthen, not weaken, the researchers\u2019 hypothesis.",

    "passage": "Boldly mixing elements of poetry, fiction, drama, philosophy, and manifesto, Puerto Rican writer Giannina Braschi creates cross-genre literature that explores themes such as immigration and independence. Her works have inspired responses from individuals across different fields and in a wide range of formats, from musical compositions and a comic book to architecture and furniture design.

By describing how Braschi\u2019s blending of genres invites her audience to think about how other art forms could also engage with literature, the quotation supports the idea that the diversity of responses to Braschi\u2019s work reflects Braschi\u2019s own approach to creating literature. Choice A is incorrect because the quotation describes scholars from different countries writing essays about Braschi\u2019s use of language in her writings; it doesn\u2019t address how Braschi\u2019s creation of cross-genre literature inspires diverse types of responses, which is the claim the student makes. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation focuses on the fact that Braschi studied in several different cities, which doesn\u2019t address the student\u2019s claim that Braschi\u2019s creation of cross-genre literature inspires diverse types of responses.

    "passage": "By the early 1900s, the Singer Corporation, a US sewing machine manufacturer founded in 1851, began to see rapidly increasing sales abroad, particularly in Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

      "D) Turkey declined substantially from 1913 to 1918."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example. According to the graph, fewer than 10,000 sewing machines were sold in the Philippines in both 1903 and 1908, but nearly 30,000 were sold in 1913 and around 45,000 were sold in 1918. This increase illustrates the statement in the text that demand for Singer sewing machines grew significantly in the early twentieth century in overseas countries other than Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Choice B is incorrect because consistent sales of Singer sewing machines in New Zealand from 1903 to 1918 do not indicate that demand for the product increased but rather that demand remained relatively the same. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the data in the graph. Although sales in Australia did increase somewhat between 1903 and 1908, there was very little change between 1908 and 1913, and then sales declined between 1913 and 1918. The data for Australia, then, do not show a steady increase from 1903 to 1918. Choice D is incorrect because declining sales of Singer sewing machines in Turkey from 1913 to 1918 do not point to an increase in demand for the product but rather to a decline in demand.",

    "passage": "An archaeological team led by Piotr Bieli\u0144ski and Sultan al-Bakri found remnants of a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age board game at a site in Oman. Little is left of the game except a stone board, which is carved with a grid and has places to hold game pieces. Some scholars claim that the game was largely played by traders.",

      "A) Other examples of the game dating to the same period have been found in the remains of several homes in the region, including in one home that may have belonged to a trader.",

      "D) Remnants of other goods have been found at the site in Oman that probably also reached the location through trade."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the scholars\u2019 claim about the board game. The text explains that the remains of a 4,000-year-old board game were found in Oman. The text then states that scholars claim this board game was played mostly by traders. If the other known examples of this board game from the same time period were discovered along routes that seem to have been used primarily by traders, this finding would directly support the scholars\u2019 claim because it suggests that the game was largely played by traders who brought it with them for entertainment as they traveled. Choice A is incorrect because this finding would suggest only that a single trader may have possessed examples of the board game, perhaps for the purpose of trading or selling the game to residents of Oman. For this reason, the finding wouldn\u2019t directly support the scholars\u2019 claim that the majority of the game\u2019s players were traders. Choice B is incorrect because this finding doesn\u2019t mention the board game at all, referring only to similar games found at other sites, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars\u2019 claim about the board game. Choice D is incorrect because this finding doesn\u2019t mention the board game at all, referring only to the remains of other goods found at the site in Oman, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars\u2019 claim about the board game.",

    "question": "Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the researchers\u2019 prediction?",
    "passage": "In the \u201clanguage nest\u201d model of education, Indigenous children learn the language of their people by using it as the medium of instruction and socialization at pre-K or elementary levels. In their 2016 study of a school in an Anishinaabe community in Ontario, Canada, scholars Lindsay Morcom and Stephanie Roy (who are Anishinaabe themselves) found that the model not only imparted fluency in the Anishinaabe language but also enhanced students\u2019 pride in Anishinaabe culture overall. Given these positive effects, Morcom and Roy predict that the model increases the probability that as adults, former students of the school will transmit the language to younger generations in their community.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Anishinaabe adults who didn\u2019t attend the school feel roughly the same degree of cultural pride as the former students of the school feel.",
      "B) After transferring to the school, new students experience an increase in both fluency and academic performance overall.",
      "C) As adults, former students of the school are just as likely to continue living in their community as individuals who didn\u2019t attend the school.",
      "D) As they complete secondary and higher education, former students of the school experience no loss of fluency or cultural pride."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers\u2019 prediction about the language nest model of education. The text states that Morcom and Roy studied the effects of the language nest model of education on students at an Anishinaabe school, and they found that the model\u2014which is used with students during pre-K or elementary school\u2014increased students\u2019 fluency in the Anishinaabe language and pride in Anishinaabe culture. The researchers predicted that the students\u2019 positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be more likely to later share the language with younger generations. If former students maintain full fluency and cultural pride after finishing secondary and higher education, it follows that they would be both able and motivated to share what they know with others; this would likely result in a higher probability of transmitting the language to younger generations, as the researchers predict. Choice A is incorrect because finding that Anishinaabe adults who didn\u2019t attend the school feel approximately the same degree of cultural pride as those adults who did attend wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 prediction that former students will be more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations. This finding would identify a similarity between the groups rather than a factor that might make former students more likely than other adults to transmit the language to younger people. Choice B is incorrect because finding that new students experience increased performance in language fluency and academics would suggest that the school has a positive effect on students when they attended but wouldn\u2019t reveal anything about those students\u2019 later actions as adults (such as their likelihood of sharing their knowledge with younger generations). Choice C is incorrect because finding that Anishinaabe adults who attended the school are equally likely to stay in the community as adults who didn\u2019t attend the school wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 prediction that former students will be more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations.

    "passage": "When digging for clams, their primary food, sea otters damage the roots of eelgrass plants growing on the seafloor. Near Vancouver Island in Canada, the otter population is large and well established, yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those found elsewhere off Canada\u2019s coast. To explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant\u2019s rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadow\u2019s health overall.",

      "D) At some sites in the study, the health of plants unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken Foster\u2019s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots improves the health of eelgrass meadows by boosting genetic diversity. The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there\u2019s a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don\u2019t have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn\u2019t leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster\u2019s hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn\u2019t weaken Foster\u2019s hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn\u2019t be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn\u2019t undermine Foster\u2019s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster\u2019s hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn\u2019t reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster\u2019s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.",

The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli).

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells. The text explains that perovskite solar cells\u2019 efficiency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor\u2019s team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion efficiency. The graph displays data on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor\u2019s team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion efficiency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more efficient than those applied though traditional spin coating. Thus, the data support Taylor and colleagues\u2019 conclusion about spray coating\u2019s potential value. Choice A is incorrect. Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn\u2019t support or relate to Taylor and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that spray coating promises greater efficiency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because Taylor and colleagues\u2019 conclusion is based on the difference in the power conversion efficiency of ETLs applied through spray coating and that of ETLs applied through spin coating, not on the difference between the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs applied through just spray coating.",

    "passage": "Earth\u2019s atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic dust originating from several sources: short-period comets (SPCs), particles from the asteroid belt (ASTs), Halley-type comets (HTCs), and Oort cloud comets (OCCs). Some of the dust\u2019s material vaporizes in the atmosphere in a process called ablation, and the faster the particles move, the higher the rate of ablation. Astrophysicist Juan Diego Carrillo-S\u00e1nchez led a team that calculated average ablation rates for elements in the dust (such as iron and potassium) and showed that material in slower-moving SPC or AST dust has a lower rate than the same material in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively completes the example regarding the ablation rate of iron. The table shows the ablation rates for three elements\u2014iron, potassium, and sodium\u2014found in cosmic dust that comes from one of four sources. The text says that the ablation rate for a given element in slower-moving SPC and AST dust was lower than the ablation rate for that same element in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. The text then presents the first part of an example of this pattern, describing an ablation rate of 28% for iron in AST dust. The information that iron from HTC dust had an ablation rate of 90% is therefore the most effective way to complete this example\u2014the comparison of a relatively low ablation rate for iron in slower-moving AST dust with a relatively high ablation rate for iron in faster-moving HTC dust illustrates the tendency of ablation rates for a given element to be lower in slower-moving dust than in faster-moving dust. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that SPC dust, like AST dust, moves relatively slowly; a comparison of the ablation rates of iron from two slower-moving dust sources could not be an example of the difference between ablation rates in slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, which is the pattern that the example is supposed to illustrate. Choice B is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Choice D is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Additionally, any ablation rate from AST dust would be ineffective in this example since AST dust is referenced in the first part of the example and thus additional data focused on AST dust would not illustrate a variation across dust types.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about average rainfall in September in select Puerto Rican cities. The graph shows that between 1981 and 2010 Rinc\u00f3n, Ponce, and Isabela all had an average rainfall during the month of September of about 6 inches, and San Sebasti\u00e1n had an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches. Describing the average September rainfall of Rinc\u00f3n, Ponce, and Isabela as below 8 inches and the average September rainfall of San Sebasti\u00e1n as greater than 8 inches therefore offers an accurate description of the data in the graph and most effectively completes the statement. Choice A is incorrect because it offers an inaccurate interpretation of the data in the graph. The graph shows that in September, Rinc\u00f3n, Isabela, and Ponce all have an average rainfall of about 6 inches, and San Sebasti\u00e1n has an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches. Therefore, Rinc\u00f3n\u2019s average rainfall is the same as, not greater than, that of Isabela and Ponce, and it is below, not greater than, that of San Sebasti\u00e1n. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the graph. In September, Rinc\u00f3n and Ponce have an average rainfall of about 6 inches, not 5 inches; Isabela has an average rainfall of about 6 inches, not 10 inches; and San Sebasti\u00e1n has an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches, not 10 inches. Choice D is incorrect because although the graph shows a similar average rainfall (about 6 inches) for Rinc\u00f3n and Isabela in September, it doesn\u2019t show that Ponce has a similar average rainfall to San Sebasti\u00e1n during this month. In September, Ponce\u2019s average rainfall is about 6 inches, whereas San Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s average rainfall is nearly 11 inches.",

    "passage": "Native to Latin America, the cane toad was introduced to Australia in the 1930s. In recent decades, tadpoles in the Australian population have been shown to consume eggs of their own species. A 2022 study showed that when presented with cane toad eggs as well as eggs of native Australian amphibians, cane toad tadpoles disproportionately consumed eggs of their own species. This behavior results from their attraction to bufadienolide, a chemical produced by the eggs of cane toads but not by the eggs of native amphibians.

      "D) The tadpoles consumed the same percentage of the dainty green tree frog eggs as they did of the little red tree frog eggs."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the student\u2019s argument about the role of bufadienolide in the egg preferences of cane toad tadpoles. For each of five amphibian species included in the 2022 study, the table gives the percentage of available eggs that the cane toad tadpoles ate. According to the table, the tadpoles ate 10% of striped burrowing frog eggs and 1% of dainty green tree frog eggs, which suggests a preference for striped burrowing frog eggs over dainty green tree frog eggs. The table also indicates that neither of these species\u2019 eggs produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data suggest that something other than the presence or absence of bufadienolide is needed to adequately explain the tadpoles\u2019 egg preferences. Choice B is incorrect. Although the table shows that for each of the five amphibian species, the cane toad tadpoles ate less than 100% of that species\u2019 eggs, which demonstrates that the tadpoles did indeed leave some eggs for each species unharmed, this fact alone is irrelevant to the tadpoles\u2019 preferences for some species\u2019 eggs over other species\u2019 eggs. Choice C is incorrect. Although the table indicates that the cane toad tadpoles ate 90% of the cane toad eggs and 7% of the short-footed frog eggs, which suggests that they prefer cane toad eggs over short-footed frog eggs, the table also indicates that cane toad eggs produce bufadienolide, whereas short-footed frog eggs do not. Therefore, these data are not sufficient to exclude that bufadienolide alone could explain the tadpoles\u2019 preference for some species\u2019 eggs over other species\u2019 eggs. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that for both dainty green tree frog eggs and little red tree frog eggs, the cane toad tadpoles ate 1% of those species\u2019 eggs, it also indicates that neither produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data alone don\u2019t indicate bufadienolide\u2019s role in the tadpoles\u2019 egg preferences.",

The researchers found that, due to slight differences in feather shape, the feathers of migratory forked-tailed flycatcher males make a sound during flight that is higher pitched than that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize that fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the specific sound made by the males of their own subspecies, and that over time the females\u2019 preference will drive further genetic and anatomical divergence between the subspecies.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support G\u00f3mez-Baham\u00f3n and her team\u2019s hypothesis about fork-tailed flycatchers. The text indicates that although two subspecies of the birds live in the same region, the tail feathers of the migrating males make a higher-pitched sound than the tail feathers of the nonmigrating males do. G\u00f3mez-Baham\u00f3n and her team hypothesize that female fork-tailed flycatchers are attracted to the particular sound made by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will bring about additional \u201cgenetic and anatomical divergence\u201d between the two subspecies. If it were found that the pitch generated by the tail feathers of migrating males is getting higher over successive generations, it would indicate that the shape of the migrating subspecies\u2019 tail feathers is diverging further from that of the nonmigrating subspecies. And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it were found that migrating males\u2019 tail feathers were producing higher pitches over time, that would support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because the researchers\u2019 hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding is about the shape of wing feathers and how that affects long-distance flight, whereas the hypothesis is about the shape of tail feathers and how that relates to female mate preference. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers\u2019 hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding focuses on how the tail feather sounds communicate different messages, which doesn\u2019t address differences between the subspecies or female preferences.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the researchers\u2019 hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. The finding that breeding habits haven\u2019t changed for either subspecies does not, by itself, suggest anything about female preferences or divergence between the two subspecies.",

    "choices": [
      "A) \u201cI see, you don\u2019t wish to stop; I don\u2019t care to stay on here either.\u201d",
      "B) \u201cOh, flower gathering? That is why your feet seem so glad and your anklets jingle so merrily as you walk.\u201d",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that Amal imagines the people he sees are carefree even when engaged in work. In the quotation, Amal observes that the flower seller\u2019s daughter is \u201cflower gathering,\u201d or working, as the text indicates. Moreover, Amal notes that the daughter\u2019s feet \u201cseem so glad\u201d and her \u201canklets jingle so merrily,\u201d suggesting that Amal believes that the flower seller\u2019s daughter is cheerful. Choice A is incorrect because the quotation makes no observation about the cheerful mood of the flower seller\u2019s daughter. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation discusses how Amal envisions his future, not the feelings of the flower seller\u2019s daughter. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation discusses Amal\u2019s wishes, not the feelings of the flower seller\u2019s daughter.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Rodriguez and colleagues\u2019 assertion about the classifications of the five new gas exoplanets. The text describes two categories of gas planets: hot Jupiters, which have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, and warm Jupiters, which have the same mass characteristic but have orbital periods of more than 10 days. According to the table, four of the gas exoplanets discovered by Rodriguez and colleagues have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, while one of the planets has a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of more than 10 days. These data therefore support Rodriguez and colleagues\u2019 assertion that four of the new exoplanets are hot Jupiters and one is a warm Jupiter. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table shows that TOI-628 b has a mass equivalent to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that one of the planets\u2014TOI-1478 b\u2014does indeed have an orbital period of more than 10 days. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table does show that the masses of the five planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 10.180 days, not 153 days. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of only 4.720 days, not more than 10 days. Additionally, although the table does show that all the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, the text indicates that a planet may be classified as a hot Jupiter or a warm Jupiter based on its mass and orbital period, not on its radius, making the information about the range of the five planets\u2019 radius values irrelevant.",

    "question": "Which quotation from an article about One Night in Miami... would be the most effective evidence for the student to include in support of this claim?",
    "passage": "A student is writing a paper about*One Night in Miami...*, a 2020 film directed by Regina King and written by Kemp Powers. Powers adapted the film\u2019s screenplay from his 2013 play, which he wrote after learning about a 1964 meeting that took place in Miami, Florida, between four prominent figures of the Civil Rights movement: Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, and Sam Cooke. The student claims that although Powers was inspired by this meeting, the film is best understood not as a precise retelling of historical events but rather as a largely imagined but informed representation of them.",
    "choices": [
      "A) \u201cWhen Powers learned of the meeting, he initially planned to write a much longer work about its four famous participants rather than focusing on the meeting itself.\u201d",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it provides a quotation that effectively supports the student\u2019s claim about the film One Night in Miami\u2026. The quotation states that in researching the play on which the film was based, Kemp Powers only found superficial details about what actually happened during the 1964 meeting in Miami between four leading Civil Rights leaders, meaning that there is very little information about the meeting in the historical record. In the absence of greater details, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible for the film to be a precise retelling of the historical events it depicts. The quotation explains that to compensate for this lack of information about the meeting, Powers did extensive research into the four figures and how they thought at the time in order to speculate in an informed way about what they might have said or what might have occurred between them. Therefore, the quotation effectively supports the claim that the film is best understood not as a precise retelling of a historical event but as a deeply informed imaginative rendering of that event. Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, Powers was inspired to write a play and, later, to adapt it into a screenplay, it doesn\u2019t discuss Powers\u2019s approach to representing what had occurred in the meeting. Instead, it states that Powers didn\u2019t initially plan to write a story only \u201cfocusing on the meeting itself\u201d but rather had considered writing a \u201cmuch longer\u201d and more expansive work about the meeting\u2019s four participants. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn\u2019t discuss Powers\u2019s approach to representing historical events in his play and in the film; instead, the quotation focuses on the film\u2019s positive critical reception by mentioning that it received numerous awards and nominations. Choice C is incorrect. Although the quotation references historical events that are discussed directly in the play and film by explaining how the four historical figures featured in the story engage in political debates about contemporary issues, it doesn\u2019t specify to what extent Powers\u2019s representation of what occurred during the 1964 meeting in Miami is a factual retelling of what happened and how much is an imaginative rendering of what might have happened. Rather, the quotation focuses on Powers\u2019s description of the film\u2019s basic premise and how the characters engage with the historical context of its setting.",

Using survey data that revealed whether respondents voted in national elections and how knowledgeable respondents are about politics, Charles and Stephens claim that the likelihood of voting is driven in part by potential voters\u2019 confidence in their assessments of candidates\u2014essentially, the more informed voters are about politics, the more confident they are at evaluating whether candidates share their views, and thus the more likely they are to vote.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively support Charles and Stephens\u2019s claim about how level of information affects voters. The graph shows the probability of voting for both high- and low-information voters in seven categories of political orientation. Charles and Stephens claim that \u201cthe more informed voters are about politics\u2026the more likely they are to vote.\u201d This statement correctly asserts that the graph shows a higher probability of voting for high-information voters than for low-information voters at each of the seven political orientations. Thus, this statement accurately cites data from the graph that support Charles and Stephens\u2019s claim about how level of information affects voters. Choice B is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the only probability in the graph below 50% is for low-information voters categorized as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice C is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the highest probabilities of voting for low-information voters are at the ends of the orientation scale (1 and 7), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice D is incorrect because the graph does not give any information about how many people are represented in any of the categories, so this statement is not based on data from the graph.

    "question": "Which finding from Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 study, if true, would most directly support their conclusion?",
    "passage": "The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a band of clouds that encircles Earth in the tropics and is a major rainfall source, shifts position in response to temperature variations across Earth\u2019s hemispheres. Data from Huagapo Cave in Peru suggest the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age (circa 1300\u20131850), but a shift as far into South America as Huagapo should have led to dry conditions in Central America, which is inconsistent with climate models. To resolve the issue, geologist Yemane Asmerom and colleagues collected data from Yok Balum Cave in Central America and compared them with the Huagapo data. They concluded that during the Little Ice Age, the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifted.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Neither the Yok Balum data nor the Huagapo data show significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age.",
      "B) Both the Yok Balum data and the Huagapo data show increased temperatures and prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age.",
      "C) The Yok Balum data show prolonged dry conditions during the same portions of the Little Ice Age in which the Huagapo data show heightened levels of rainfall.",
      "D) The Yok Balum data and the Huagapo data show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than shifting south during the Little Ice Age. The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru\u2019s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted. Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth\u2019s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 claim.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues\u2019 conclusion, not strengthen it. Such a finding would suggest that the ITCZ shifted south and left Central America dry rather than expanding both northward and southward.",

    "passage": "The largest tyrannosaurids\u2014the family of carnivorous dinosaurs that includes*Tarbosaurus*,*Albertosaurus*, and, most famously,*Tyrannosaurus**rex*\u2014are thought to have had the strongest bites of any land animals in Earth\u2019s history. Determining the bite force of extinct animals can be difficult, however, and paleontologists Paul Barrett and Emily Rayfield have suggested that an estimate of dinosaur bite force may be significantly influenced by the methodology used in generating that estimate.",

      "A) The study by Meers used body-mass scaling and produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force, while the study by Cost et al. used muscular and skeletal modeling and produced the highest estimated maximum.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield\u2019s suggestion about bite force estimates. According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them\u2014that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000\u201357,000 newtons and 35,000\u201363,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000\u2013235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000\u201334,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield\u2019s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn\u2019t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson\u2019s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can\u2019t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don\u2019t support Barrett and Rayfield\u2019s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates.",

    "passage": "In the mountains of Brazil,*Barbacenia tomentosa*and*Barbacenia macrantha*\u2014two plants in the Velloziaceae family\u2014establish themselves on soilless, nutrient-poor patches of quartzite rock. Plant ecologists Anna Abrah\u00e3o and Patricia de Britto Costa used microscopic analysis to determine that the roots of*B. tomentosa *and*B. macrantha*, which grow directly into the quartzite, have* *clusters of fine hairs near the root tip; further analysis indicated that these hairs secrete both malic and citric acids.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis about the plants\u2019 dependence on dissolving rock. The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorous, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage\u2014such as access to phosphorous\u2014from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don\u2019t benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don\u2019t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit. Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn\u2019t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There\u2019s no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn\u2019t actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the underlined claim. The text indicates that Swahili is the first language of up to 15 million people worldwide. The text goes on to claim, in the underlined portion, that even in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili, many of the language\u2019s speakers don\u2019t have Swahili as their first language. The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language. This information about Swahili speakers in Tanzania therefore supports the claim that many Swahili speakers in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili speak it as a language other than their first language (such as their second, third, or fourth language). Choice B is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t accurately describe information in the table. According to the table, Tanzania has 61 million Swahili speakers, not at most 15 million Swahili speakers. Additionally, the table indicates that 100 percent of Tanzania\u2019s population speak Swahili, which means that the number of Swahili speakers in the country and the country\u2019s total population should be the same, not that they should differ by such a large amount. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s no information in the table or the text that indicates where people who speak Swahili as their first language live. Although Kenya\u2019s total population can be inferred from the table\u2014if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and 100% of Kenya\u2019s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people\u2014nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that 100 percent of Kenya\u2019s population and 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s population speak Swahili, this comparison is irrelevant to the claim that Swahili isn\u2019t the first language of many of its speakers even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili.

    "question": "Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researcher\u2019s hypothesis?",
    "passage": "When hibernating, Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels enter a state called torpor, which minimizes the energy their bodies need to function. Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn less energy keeping warm during these episodes than they would if they were alone. A researcher hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots.",
    "choices": [
      "A) The Alaska marmots\u2019 arousal episodes lasted for days, while the Arctic ground squirrels\u2019 arousal episodes lasted less than a day.",
      "B) The Alaska marmots and the Arctic ground squirrels both maintained torpor for several consecutive days per bout, on average.",
      "C) The Alaska marmots had shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the Arctic ground squirrels did.",
      "D) The Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts than arousal episodes, but their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support the researcher\u2019s hypothesis. According to the text, the researcher hypothesized that Arctic ground squirrels would exhibit longer torpor bouts and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots do\u2014or, put the other way, that the marmots would show shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the ground squirrels do. The table shows data about torpor bouts and arousal episodes for the two species from 2008 to 2011. According to the table, the average duration of torpor bouts was 13.81 days for Alaska marmots, shorter than the average of 16.77 days for Arctic ground squirrels, and the average duration of arousal episodes was 21.2 hours for Alaska marmots, longer than the average of 14.2 hours for Arctic ground squirrels. Thus, the table supports the researcher\u2019s hypothesis by showing that Alaska marmots had shorter bouts of torpor and longer arousal episodes than Arctic ground squirrels did. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table and doesn\u2019t support the researcher\u2019s hypothesis. The table shows that the average duration of arousal episodes was less than a day for both Alaska marmots (21.2 hours) and Arctic ground squirrels (14.2 hours). Additionally, information about arousal episodes for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels isn\u2019t sufficient to support a hypothesis involving comparisons of both arousal episodes and torpor bouts for those animals. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t support the researcher\u2019s hypothesis, which involves comparisons of arousal episodes as well as torpor bouts for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. Noting that both animals had torpor bouts lasting several days, on average, doesn\u2019t address arousal episodes at all, nor does it reveal how the animals\u2019 torpor bouts compared.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t support the researcher\u2019s hypothesis. Although the table does show that Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts (12) than arousal episodes (11) and that their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts (21.2 hours and 13.81 days, respectively), comparing data across only Alaska marmot behaviors isn\u2019t sufficient to support a hypothesis about torpor and arousal behaviors of both Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels.",

According to the text, the student hypothesizes that Brassica rapa parachinensis (choy sum) will benefit more from acidic soil than it will from neutral soil. The text then explains that the student planted 16 choy sum seeds in potting soil with coffee grounds added to increase acidity and another 16 seeds in soil without coffee grounds as a control (a group identical to the experimental group except for the experimental modification being tested). If the hypothesis were correct, the plants in the more acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture would grow faster than those in the control group. However, choice A proposes a scenario in which the plants in soil without coffee grounds were \u201csignificantly taller\u201d than those in the more acidic mixture\u2014an outcome that weakens the hypothesis that higher acidity is beneficial to the plants\u2019 growth. Choice B is incorrect. If the choy sum planted in the neutral soil produced less plant matter and therefore weighed less than the choy sum planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen the student\u2019s hypothesis, not weaken it. Choice C is incorrect. If seeds planted in neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly later than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student\u2019s hypothesis that acidic soil benefits choy sum. Choice D is incorrect. If seeds planted in the neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly fewer plants than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture did, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student\u2019s hypothesis that choy sum benefits from acidic soil.",

    "passage": "Alicia Montesinos-Navarro, Isabelle Storer, and Roc\u00edo Perez-Barrales recently examined several plots within a diverse plant community in southeast Spain. The researchers calculated that if individual plants were randomly distributed on this particular landscape, only about 15% would be with other plants in patches of vegetation. They counted the number of juvenile plants of five species growing in patches of vegetation and the number growing alone on bare ground and compared those numbers to what would be expected if the plants were randomly distributed. Based on these results, they claim that plants of these species that grow in close proximity to other plants gain an advantage at an early developmental stage.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. The table shows the total number of juvenile plants from five species that were found growing on bare ground and in patches of vegetation as well as the percentage of the total number of each species that were growing in patches of vegetation. For each of the five species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the five species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This finding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it\u2019s advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation. Choice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn\u2019t clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn\u2019t indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn\u2019t advantageous.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which was the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the finding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all five species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that finding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous.",

If Medina and her colleagues found that species that build open nests tend to have larger geographic ranges than species that build domed nests do, their finding would show the opposite of what the ecologists have assumed.

Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there\u2019s a relationship between songbird species\u2019 extinction rates and their geographic ranges.

    "passage": "Given that stars and planets initially form from the same gas and dust in space, some astronomers have posited that host stars (such as the Sun) and their planets (such as those in our solar system) are composed of the same materials, with the planets containing equal or smaller quantities of the materials that make up the host star.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken the astronomers\u2019 claim about the makeup of host stars and their planets. The text explains that because stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust, astronomers believe planets should be composed of the same materials as their host stars, but in equal or smaller quantities. The finding that the amount of iron in some rocky planets is much higher than the amount in their host star would weaken the astronomers\u2019 claim because it would show that some planets contain the same material as their host star, but in higher quantities. Choice A is incorrect because a finding only about the makeup of stars, whether they\u2019ve cooled or not, would provide no information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about two host stars having similar proportions of certain materials wouldn\u2019t provide any information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn\u2019t be relevant to the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the astronomers\u2019 claim is based on a fact\u2014that stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust in space\u2014which would remain true regardless of the effectiveness of a method for analysis of compositions. The text does cite analysis of rocky planets in our solar system and the Sun, but only as a single piece of evidence that is consistent with the claim and not as the source of the claim; the finding that the method used for that analysis is less effective in other scenarios wouldn\u2019t weaken a claim that\u2019s based on knowledge of how stars and planets initially form.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the scholar\u2019s claim about Toni Morrison\u2019s likely goal of strengthening the presence of Black writers on Random House\u2019s list of published authors. The text explains that Morrison was the first Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s\u2014during most of Morrison\u2019s time working there\u2014than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House\u2019s published authors, thus supporting the scholar\u2019s claim. Choice B is incorrect because the scholar\u2019s claim is about Morrison\u2019s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company\u2019s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison\u2019s novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn\u2019t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar\u2019s claim is about Morrison\u2019s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison\u2019s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House\u2019s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison\u2019s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar\u2019s claim focuses on Morrison\u2019s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House\u2019s list of published authors, not on the influence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison\u2019s stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House.",

    "passage": "Black beans (*Phaseolus vulgaris*) are a nutritionally dense food, but they are difficult to digest in part because of their high levels of soluble fiber and compounds like raffinose. They also contain antinutrients like tannins and trypsin inhibitors, which interfere with the body\u2019s ability to extract nutrients from foods. In a research article, Marisela Granito and Glenda \u00c1lvarez from Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University in Venezuela claim that inducing fermentation of black beans using lactic acid bacteria improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious.",

      "D) Both fermented and nonfermented black beans contained significantly fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins after being cooked at high pressure."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that would best support Granito and \u00c1lvarez\u2019s claim that fermenting black beans makes them easier to digest and more nutritious. The text indicates that high levels of soluble fiber and raffinose in black beans make the beans hard to digest and that tannins and trypsin inhibitors make it harder for the body to extract nutrients from the beans. If it were found that fermenting the beans significantly reduces their levels of soluble fiber, raffinose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body\u2019s ability to extract nutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would likely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and \u00c1lvarez claim). Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address the idea that greater nitrogen absorption in the gut has an effect on a food\u2019s digestibility or level of nutrition, so the discovery of the presence of microorganisms that may increase nitrogen absorption wouldn\u2019t provide relevant support for the claim that fermentation makes black beans easier to digest and more nutritious. Choice D is incorrect because Granito and \u00c1lvarez\u2019s claim focuses on the effect of fermenting black beans, but the finding that nonfermented black beans also have fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins when cooked at high pressure would suggest that the role of the cooking method could be significant when it comes to nutrition; further, the finding wouldn\u2019t address the beans\u2019 digestibility.",

    "passage": "Many archaeologists will tell you that categorizing excavated fragments of pottery by style, period, and what objects they belong to relies not only on standard criteria, but also on instinct developed over years of practice. In a recent study, however, researchers trained a deep-learning computer model on thousands of images of pottery fragments and found that it could categorize them as accurately as a team of expert archaeologists.

      "D) A survey of archaeologists showed that few of them received dedicated training in how to properly categorize pottery fragments."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers\u2019 claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text explains that although archaeologists hold that categorizing pottery fragments relies on both objective criteria and instinct developed through direct experience, researchers have found that a computer model can categorize the fragments with the same degree of accuracy as the humans can\u2014a finding that has caused some archaeologists to worry that their own work won\u2019t be needed any longer. If survey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren\u2019t able to do all of the important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers\u2019 claim that computer models are unlikely to replace human archaeologists. Choice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers\u2019 claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists\u2019 work not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer model and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text indicates that some archaeologists are worried because the computer model\u2019s accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether both were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models.

According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%\u201339% of maximal speed, 40%\u201349% of maximal speed, 50%\u201359% of maximal speed, 60%\u201369% of maximal speed, 70%\u201379% of maximal speed, 80%\u201389% of maximal speed, and 90%\u2013100% of maximal speed, respectively.

    "passage": "The only flowering plant species native to Antarctica,*Colobanthus quitensis *and* Deschampsia antarctica*grow in places where the earth remains free of ice for much of the year. Botanist Niccoletta Cannone wondered how the warming of Antarctica\u2019s climate in recent years had affected these species, so she visited a site in Antarctica, first in 2009 and later in 2018, to count the number of plants growing there. Cannone found that the area of land covered by the two species had significantly expanded during the nine-year period. While both species likely benefited from warming temperatures,* Colobanthus quitensis *______blank",
    "choices": [
      "A) suppressed the growth of Deschampsia antarctica, which covered a smaller area of land in 2018 than it had in 2009.",
      "B) saw a greater expansion than Deschampsia antarctica did, increasing the area of land it covered by more than half.",
      "C) showed a greater increase in the average size of individual plants than Deschampsia antarctica did.",
      "D) covered land newly freed from ice at a rate 55% faster than that of Deschampsia antarctica."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the comparison of how Colobanthus quitensis benefited from warming temperatures with how Deschampsia antarctica benefited from them. The table shows the land area covered by these two plant species at a site in Antarctica. According to the table, Colobanthus quitensis increased the area it covered by 55% from 2009 to 2018, whereas Deschampsia antarctica increased the area it covered by 28% during the same period. It therefore follows that Colobanthus quitensis saw a greater expansion than Deschampsia antarctica did and that Colobanthus quitensis increased the area of land it covered by more than half. Choice A is incorrect because according to the table, Deschampsia antarctica covered 1,230 square meters of land in 2009 and 1,576 square meters of land in 2018. Deschampsia antarctica therefore covered a larger, not a smaller, area of land in 2018 than in 2009. Moreover, there\u2019s no information in the text or the table that suggests that one species of the plant suppressed the other. Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the table. The table shows the land area covered by Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica and the percent increase in area covered by the two species from 2009 to 2018, not the average size of individual plants belonging to the two species. The data in the table therefore can\u2019t be used to make a comparison of the increase in individual plants\u2019 average size. Choice D is incorrect because the table shows the land area covered by Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica and the percent increase in area covered by the two species from 2009 to 2018, not the rate at which the species increased the area they covered. Moreover, there\u2019s nothing in the table or the text that suggests that the areas covered by the two species were newly freed from ice.",

    "question": "Which finding from the experiment, if true, would most directly support Garza and Robles\u2019s hypothesis?",
    "passage": "Ochre sea stars live in tidal pools along the shoreline of the Pacific Ocean. At night, they move to higher shore levels in search of prey. But scientists Corey Garza and Carlos Robles noticed that ochre sea stars stayed at lower levels at night after heavy rains. Garza and Robles hypothesized that a layer of fresh water formed by rainfall was a barrier to the sea stars. To test their hypothesis, the scientists did an experiment. They placed some sea stars in a climbable tank of seawater and other sea stars in a similar tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. Then, the scientists watched the sea stars\u2019 behavior at night.",

      "C) Both groups of sea stars climbed to the tops of the tanks, but sea stars in the tank with only seawater climbed more slowly than sea stars in the other tank did.",

The text explains that the sea stars tend to move to higher shore levels at night in search of prey, but after a heavy rain, the sea stars stay at lower shore levels.

To determine whether fresh water forms a barrier to sea stars, Garza and Robles observed how sea stars behaved in a tank of only seawater and in a tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. If the sea stars climbed to the top of the tank with only seawater but stopped climbing just below the layer of fresh water in the other tank, that would suggest that fresh water does indeed serve as a barrier to the sea stars, thereby supporting Garza and Robles\u2019s hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because finding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater moved around the bottom of the tank more than sea stars in the other tank did but that none of the stars in either tank climbed to the top would be irrelevant to Garza and Robles\u2019s hypothesis. Such a finding would reveal nothing about whether fresh water serves as a barrier to sea stars. Choice C is incorrect because finding that sea stars climbed to the top of both tanks would weaken, not support, Garza and Robles\u2019s hypothesis, since it would indicate that the layer of fresh water wasn\u2019t a barrier to the sea stars. Choice D is incorrect because finding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater mostly stayed near the bottom of the tank but sea stars in the other tank climbed into the layer of fresh water wouldn\u2019t support Garza and Robles\u2019s hypothesis. Instead, such a finding would suggest that the layer of fresh water wasn\u2019t a barrier to the sea stars, thereby weakening Garza and Robles\u2019s hypothesis.",

    "question": "Which finding from the experiment, if true, would most directly support Bernal and de Silva\u2019s conclusion?",
    "passage": "Male t\u00fangara frogs make complex calls to attract mates, but their calls also attract frog-biting midges, insects that feed on the frogs\u2019 blood. Researchers Ximena Bernal and Priyanka de Silva wondered if the calls alone are sufficient for midges to locate the frogs or if midges use carbon dioxide emitted by frogs as an additional cue to their prey\u2019s whereabouts, like mosquitoes do. In an experiment, the researchers placed two midge traps in a t\u00fangara frog breeding area. One trap played recordings of t\u00fangara frog calls and the other released carbon dioxide along with playing the calls. Bernal and de Silva concluded that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Only a small number of midges were found in the traps, though the majority were found in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide.",
      "B) Midges entered the trap that released carbon dioxide and played calls only during or immediately after periods of carbon dioxide release.",
      "C) More midges were found in the trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide.",
      "D) The trap that released carbon dioxide and played calls attracted few midges when carbon dioxide concentrations were low but attracted many midges when carbon dioxide concentrations were high."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges regarding the location of male t\u00fangara frogs. The text begins by stating that the mating call of the male t\u00fangara frogs also attracts frog-biting midges, which prey on the frogs\u2019 blood. Researchers Bernal and de Silva were curious if the mating calls were sufficient signals for the midges to locate the frogs or if midges also used carbon dioxide emitted by the frogs to locate their prey. The text then details the procedure the researchers used to investigate their question and summarizes their conclusion\u2014that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the midges. Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers\u2019 trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem sufficient without the carbon dioxide cue. This finding supports the researchers\u2019 conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges. Choice A is incorrect because finding that the majority of frog-biting midges were found in the traps that both played the mating call and released carbon dioxide would present evidence that directly refutes the researchers\u2019 conclusion\u2014that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the frog-biting midges regarding the location of t\u00fangara frogs. Choice B is incorrect because if the midges entered the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide only during or immediately after carbon dioxide was released, that would suggest that the midges used the carbon dioxide as a way to locate their prey, a finding that would contradict the researchers\u2019 conclusion that carbon dioxide was not an additional cue to the midges. Choice D is incorrect because a trap attracting larger numbers of midges with high carbon dioxide concentrations than a trap with low carbon dioxide concentrations suggests that carbon dioxide might serve as an additional cue to the midges as to the location on the frogs, a finding contrary to the researchers\u2019 conclusion.",

    "passage": "In 2006, Nitya Kallivayalil and colleagues calculated the most accurate estimate yet of the average velocity (in kilometers per second) of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy. Before the 2006 study, estimates of the average velocity were low enough for the LMC to maintain an orbit around the Milky Way galaxy, but according to an analysis by Gurtina Besla and colleagues, the estimated velocity from the 2006 study is too high for the LMC to maintain such an orbit.

      "C) above 378 km/s.",
      "D) below 297 km/s."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the table to give the range of velocities for the LMC from the 1980 value (344 km/s) to the 2006 value (378 km/s), thereby effectively completing the text. The text indicates that before 2006, all the estimated velocities of the LMC were within the range necessary to maintain orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. It then indicates that, according to Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is too high to maintain that orbit. This strongly implies that if the 1980 value (344 km/s) is below the orbital threshold, and if Besla and colleagues are correct that the 2006 value (378 km/s) is above that threshold, the maximum orbital velocity for the LMC must be somewhere in the range from above 344 km/s to below 378 km/s. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the first estimate that exceeded the velocity needed to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1980 estimate of 344 km/s and the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must both be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that Besla and colleagues\u2019 analysis found that the velocity from the 2006 study (378 km/s) was too high for the LMC to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Therefore, if a velocity of 378 km/s is too high, an even higher velocity will also be too high. Choice D is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the first to exceed the velocity range required to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC.",

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text\u2019s discussion of the percentages of maize exported in the marketing year 2012/2013. The graph presents percentages of maize exported by Argentina, Brazil, and the United States in marketing years 2009/2010 to 2013/2014 and indicates that for the marketing year 2012/2013, the percentage of maize exported by Argentina decreased to about 70 percent from about 80 percent in the previous marketing year. The graph also shows that the percentage of maize exported by Argentina remained highest among the three countries in the marketing year 2012/2013, surpassing the percentage exported by Brazil (about 31 percent) and by the United States (about 8 percent). Choice A is incorrect because for the marketing year 2012/2013, the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil didn\u2019t increase from the previous year; rather, it decreased from about 34 percent to about 31 percent. Moreover, the graph shows that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil remained higher, not lower, than the percentage exported by the United States in the marketing year 2012/2013. Choice B is incorrect because the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil never exceeded the percentage exported by Argentina for any of the marketing years represented. Choice D is incorrect because the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by the United States reached its lowest point, not its highest, during the five marketing years in 2012/2013, with the United States exporting only about 8 percent of its maize in that marketing year.",

    "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the idea advanced by Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Diehl?",
    "passage": "As media consumption has become increasingly multiplatform and socially mediated, active news acquisition has diminished in favor of an attitude known as \u201cnews finds me\u201d (NFM), in which people passively rely on their social networks and ambient media environments for information about current events. Homero Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Trevor Diehl examined data on a representative group of adults in the United States to determine participants\u2019 strength of NFM attitude, political knowledge, and political interest. Although no major election took place sufficiently near the study for Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Diehl to identify causality between NFM and voting behavior, they did posit that NFM may reduce voting probability through an indirect effect.",
    "choices": [
      "A) NFM attitude tends to increase in strength as major elections approach, and people are significantly more likely to vote in major elections than in minor elections.",
      "B) NFM attitude has a strong negative effect on political knowledge and interest, and there is known to be a strong positive correlation between political knowledge and interest and the likelihood of voting.",
      "C) Political interest is known to have a strong positive effect on likelihood of voting but shows only a weak positive effect on political knowledge, and NFM attitude shows little correlation with either political knowledge or political interest.",
      "D) The likelihood of voting increases as political knowledge increases, and the relationship between NFM attitude and political knowledge tends to strengthen as the size of people\u2019s social networks increases."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the idea advanced by Homero Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Trevor Diehl that NFM (\"news finds me\") attitude may reduce voting probability through an indirect effect. The text describes NFM as an attitude that has lowered people\u2019s interest in actively acquiring news and introduces Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Diehl\u2019s study on the effects of NFM on people in the United States\u2019 political knowledge and interest. The text goes on to say that despite the fact that the study didn\u2019t occur near a major election, Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Diehl still conclude that NFA may reduce voting probability. If the likelihood, or probability, that a person will vote is linked to that person\u2019s level of political knowledge and interest, that would suggest that negatively affecting a person\u2019s level of political knowledge and interest would also negatively affect how likely that person is to vote. Thus, if NFM attitude has a negative effect on political knowledge and interest, then it would also likely reduce voting probability. Choice A is incorrect because the finding that NFM attitude increases as major elections approach wouldn\u2019t address the effect of NFM on the likelihood of voting, which is the idea advanced by Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Diehl. Moreover, although the text mentions that there were no major elections that occurred near the time of the study, it doesn\u2019t discern between major and minor elections when discussing voting probability. Choice C is incorrect because finding that NFM attitude shows little correlation with either political knowledge or political interest would undermine, not support, Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Diehl\u2019s idea that NFM may reduce voting probability because it suggests that NFM has no effect on political knowledge or political interest. Choice D is incorrect. Although Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Diehl\u2019s idea would be supported by the finding that the likelihood of voting increases as political knowledge increases, nothing in the text suggests that the researchers\u2019 idea hinges on the size of people\u2019s social networks.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",

In the quotation, the narrator compares how she feels about places she has traveled to how she feels about the town she\u2019s from. The narrator states that although the many journeys she has made in her lifetime have brought her much pleasure, she has gained the most enjoyment from her experiences inside the borders of her hometown. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t express that the narrator likes her hometown better than other places she has visited; instead, the quotation describes something unspecified in positive terms, saying it continues to offer new things to explore and remember. Choice B is incorrect. Although the quotation praises a landscape surrounding a village, it doesn\u2019t specify that this village is the narrator\u2019s hometown, nor does it express a preference for this village over other places the narrator has visited. Choice D is incorrect. Although the quotation describes enjoyment from getting to know a region, it doesn\u2019t compare the narrator\u2019s feelings for this region with her feelings for her hometown.",

      "C) Aquatic prey like the reptiles and fish in the area provide a source of omega-3 fatty acids that aren\u2019t often found in land mammals.",
      "D) When jaguars in the area preyed on mammals, they tended to prefer semiaquatic ones like capybaras."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers\u2019 claim about the diets of jaguars in the Brazilian Pantanal. The text notes that jaguars generally eat land-based mammals, but researchers claim that jaguars in the Pantanal can survive on a diet that includes more fish and aquatic reptiles than mammals. Finding that the remains of aquatic reptiles and fish appear more often in these jaguars\u2019 waste than the remains of mammals do would support the researchers\u2019 claim, since it would suggest that fish and aquatic reptiles are a more significant part of the jaguars\u2019 diet than mammals are. Choice B is incorrect because finding that a particular aquatic reptile exists in high numbers in the area would not support the researchers\u2019 claim about the jaguars\u2019 diet. The mere presence of many aquatic reptiles nearby does not mean that the jaguars eat those reptiles, let alone survive on more aquatic reptiles and fish than mammals. Choice C is incorrect. Although finding that aquatic reptiles and fish can provide nutrients that land mammals typically do not provide could help explain why some animals eat those reptiles and fish, it would not indicate whether the jaguars in particular eat those reptiles and fish and thus would not support the researchers\u2019 claim. Choice D is incorrect because finding that when preying on mammals, jaguars prefer semiaquatic mammals, such as capybaras, would be irrelevant to the researchers\u2019 claim that the jaguars can survive on a diet of more fish and aquatic reptiles than mammals. The type of mammals the jaguars tend to eat does not indicate anything about whether fish and aquatic reptiles are part of the jaguars\u2019 diet.",

    "passage": "To test whether a medication is effective, scientists compare outcomes for patients taking it and patients taking a placebo (a medically inactive substance).

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement comparing the mean ratings for two different groups of participants in a study. The text explains that a research team evaluated the study\u2019s participants using various measures in order to learn whether there might be a medical benefit to telling patients they\u2019re receiving a placebo. The table shows the team\u2019s mean ratings for participants after 21 days for three of the measures: global improvement, symptom severity reduction, and quality of life improvement. According to the table, the mean ratings were higher for all three measures for participants aware of taking a placebo than for participants in the control group. Given that higher ratings indicate greater well-being, as the text states, the mean ratings in the table indicate greater overall well-being for participants aware of taking a placebo than for participants in the control group. Choice A is incorrect because the table doesn\u2019t include data about individual participants; rather, it presents means, or mathematical averages, of ratings. For this reason, no conclusions can be drawn from data in the table about the extent to which well-being may have varied from participant to participant. Choice B is incorrect because according to the table, the mean ratings for participants aware of taking a placebo were higher for all three measures than for participants in the control group, not lower for two of the measures. Choice C is incorrect because it cites data from the table related to participants in the control group, not to participants aware of taking a placebo. Additionally, the mean ratings in the table for participants aware of taking a placebo are higher for all three measures than for participants in the control group.

By describing Joanna as not being interested in people unless they have \"a \u2018purpose\u2019 in life\"\u2014that is, a goal they are determined to achieve\u2014in which case she is very interested in them, the quotation reveals that Joanna cares only about others\u2019 ambition. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation indicates only that Joanna has a preference for her father, without giving a reason for that preference; therefore, it doesn\u2019t illustrate the claim that Joanna cares only about others\u2019 ambition. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation doesn\u2019t illustrate that Joanna greatly admires the quality of ambition in others; it refers to Joanna\u2019s similarity to her father \"so far as ambition was concerned\" but doesn\u2019t reveal how she (or her father) views that quality. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation describes qualities Joanna possesses\u2014praising her logic, concentration, and memory\u2014instead of Joanna\u2019s interest in other people\u2019s qualities.",

In a study, data scientist Sam K. Hui and colleagues found that this effect can also be achieved with a less obvious cue: rearranging a store\u2019s layout. The researchers explain that trying to find items in new locations causes shoppers to move through more of the store, exposing them to more products and increasing the likelihood that they\u2019ll buy an item they hadn\u2019t planned on purchasing.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it best supports the researchers\u2019 explanation of the results of rearranging a store\u2019s layout. According to the text, Sam K. Hui and colleagues found that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can encourage customers to make spontaneous purchases. The text states that the researchers explain that a change in layout causes shoppers to hunt for items\u2019 new locations, which exposes the shoppers to more products and increases the likelihood that they\u2019ll make an unplanned purchase. This quotation from a surveyed shopper indicates that the shopper spontaneously purchased a notebook while looking for cleaning supplies that weren\u2019t in their usual place. The quotation therefore supports the researchers\u2019 explanation that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 explanation that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Instead of attributing an unplanned purchase to a change in layout, the quotation notes that the shopper searched for but couldn\u2019t find some items, and as a result the shopper purchased less, not more, than what was anticipated. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to coupons that the shopper received, not to a new store layout. Thus, the quotation doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 explanation that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to the size and stock of the store, not to a new store layout. The shopper simply purchased products that the shopper wanted in a particular store because other stores didn\u2019t carry those products, so the quotation doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 explanation that rearranging a store\u2019s layout can lead shoppers to make spontaneous purchases.",

    "question": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement?",
    "passage": "The population of the coral*Lophelia pertusa*declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Using the ratio of manganese to calcium, which inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, marine scientist Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues evaluated whether oxygenation played a role in the declines of*L. pertusa*. The researchers concluded that oxygenation may have been important in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast, since______blank",
    "choices": [
      "A) a substantial increase in oxygenation in the Alboran Sea corresponded with the local decline in L. pertusa, but the opposite relationship between oxygenation and L. pertusa was found near the Mauritanian coast.",
      "B) L. pertusa declined in the Alboran Sea during a period of substantial local decline in oxygenation, but L. pertusa declined near the Mauritanian coast during a period of little local change in oxygenation.",
      "C) oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in L. pertusa than after the decline, whereas oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was relatively low both before and after the decline in L. pertusa.",
      "D) oxygenation in the Alboran Sea tended to be substantially higher than oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues\u2019 conclusion. The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in L. pertusa coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reflects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph\u2019s horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of L. pertusa. The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of L. pertusa declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the L. pertusa population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the L. pertusa decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral\u2019s decline near the Mauritanian coast. Choice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in L. pertusa (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral\u2019s population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral\u2019s decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in L. pertusa than after\u2014because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after\u2014the graph doesn\u2019t support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral\u2019s decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of L. pertusa. Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn\u2019t effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of L. pertusa in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast.",

    "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis?",
    "passage": "Under normal atmospheric pressure at Earth\u2019s surface, water molecules form a tetrahedral network stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules. Extreme high pressure, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds and compresses water\u2019s structure, allowing water molecules within organisms to permeate proteins and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive correlation between the depths that various piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a compound called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces water\u2019s compressibility.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Water molecules are found to be impervious to TMAO even when the water molecules\u2019 tetrahedral configuration has been distorted by high pressure.",
      "B) Examination of TMAO\u2019s molecular structure shows that TMAO molecules retain their shape even as pressure increases.",
      "C) A positive correlation is found between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water\u2019s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.",
      "D) Analysis of water\u2019s molecular structure under high pressure reveals that hydrogen bonds are more stable when TMAO is present than when it is not."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that TMAO reduces water\u2019s compressibility. The text explains that at great depths in the ocean, extreme pressure compresses the molecular structure of water by destabilizing the hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules, thereby allowing water to penetrate proteins and harm the associated organisms. However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species\u2019 level of the compound TMAO. Because this hypothesis links TMAO levels with reduced compressibility of water\u2019s tetrahedral molecular structure, a finding that TMAO helps maintain the hydrogen bonds between water molecules under high pressure would strongly support that hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers\u2019 hypothesis suggests a relationship between TMAO and water molecules\u2019 tetrahedral molecular structure, that relationship involves TMAO helping maintain water\u2019s tetrahedral molecular structure under high pressure; as presented in the text, the hypothesis doesn\u2019t contend that water molecules are impervious to, or incapable of being penetrated by, TMAO. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers\u2019 hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher. Moreover, the positive correlation mentioned in the text is between TMAO concentrations and the depths at which piezophiles live, not between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water\u2019s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker has contradictory feelings while experiencing the sights and sounds of spring. This quotation indicates that the speaker is reclined in a grove listening to a thousand sounds. Even though the speaker is in a \"sweet mood\" and thinking \"pleasant thoughts,\" those pleasant thoughts also bring to mind \"sad thoughts.\" In other words, these lines illustrate the claim that the speaker is having contradictory thoughts while immersed in the sights and sounds of spring. Choice A is incorrect. Although this quotation refers to several flowers (primroses and periwinkles) and indicates that the speaker is in a \"bower,\" or shady spot among the trees\u2014details which suggest that the speaker is experiencing the sights of spring\u2014it doesn\u2019t suggest that the speaker is having contradictory feelings, only that the speaker believes that the flowers are experiencing enjoyment. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation focuses on the sights of spring\u2014namely, new leaves on nearby trees appear to be opening up (\"The budding twigs spread out their fan\") to feel the breeze\u2014the quotation doesn\u2019t suggest that the speaker feels conflicted about this: the statement \"And I must think, do all I can\" suggests the speaker\u2019s determination to attribute feelings of pleasure to the trees, not that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Choice C is incorrect. Although this quotation indicates that the speaker isn\u2019t certain what the birds are thinking (\"Their thoughts I cannot measure\"), there\u2019s nothing to suggest that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Rather, the quotation suggests that although the speaker is uncertain about the birds\u2019 feelings, the speaker believes that the birds\u2019 movements likely suggest their pleasure.",

The line graph shows the number of recreation visits to four US national parks for the months of June, July, and August 2021. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Yellowstone National Park in June was approximately 940,000; in July, the number of visits was approximately 1,080,000; and in August, the number of visits was approximately 920,000. In all three months, the number of visits to Yellowstone was higher than the number of visits to any other park in each month. Choice A is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Zion National Park was approximately 680,000 in June, about 580,000 in July, and about 470,000 in August, each of which is lower than the number of visits to Yellowstone in the same months. Choice B is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Rocky Mountain National Park was approximately 670,000 in June, about 900,000 in July, and about 750,000 in August, each of which is lower than the number of visits to Yellowstone in the same months. Choice D is incorrect. According to the graph, the number of recreation visits to Grand Canyon National Park was approximately 540,000 in June, about 560,000 in July, and about 430,000 in August, each of which is lower than the total visits to Yellowstone in the same months.",

    "passage": "To study how floral damage affects the behavior of pollinators, such as bees, a team of researchers punched holes in the floral tissue of flowers from the vine yellow jessamine (*Gelsemium sempervirens*), a plant that produces flowers that have either a long pistil and a short stamen (pin morphs) or a short pistil and a long stamen (thrum morphs). The researchers then compared the time different insect pollinators spent visiting intact pin and thrum flowers to the time such pollinators spent visiting the artificially damaged pin and thrum flowers. The researchers concluded that the effect of floral damage on time spent per flower varied by both floral morph and the genus of the pollinator.",
    "choices": [

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that the effect of floral damage on time spent per flower varied by both floral morph and the genus of the pollinator. The table presents the average time pollinators spent per floral morph. The data in the table shows that for pin flowers, the average time spent per flower by all pollinator genera was higher for flowers that had been artificially damaged than for intact flowers. By contrast, for thrum flowers, the difference in time spent on intact and damaged flowers is seen for only some pollinator genera. This supports the researchers\u2019 conclusion that both floral morph and the genus of the pollinator are factors involved in the effect that floral damage has on time pollinators spend per flower. Choice B is incorrect. The table shows that pollinators belonging to the genus Xylocopa spent less time on both damaged pin flowers and damaged thrum flowers than pollinators belonging to the genus Osmia did. Choice C is incorrect. The table shows that the artificial damage to the thrum flowers led to shorter average times spent by pollinators on those flowers for only two of the four pollinator genera represented in the table, not three. Furthermore, this choice doesn\u2019t address the effect the artificial damage had on pin flowers; thus, even if accurate, this evidence doesn\u2019t support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that both floral morph and pollinator genus affect time spent per flower when a flower has been damaged. Choice D is incorrect. While this statement is true based on the information in the table, it doesn\u2019t provide evidence that supports the researchers\u2019 conclusion that the effect of floral damage on time spent per flower varied by both floral morph and the genus of the pollinator because this choice provides information only about how much time one pollinator genus spent on intact flowers.",

The text explains that it has long been thought that East Australian humpback whales store extra energy during the feeding season and then use that energy to survive while traveling to their breeding grounds. If it were true that citizen scientists have often seen the whales feeding as they migrate to the breeding grounds, that would indicate that the whales sometimes feed and take in additional energy during the journey, meaning that they may not rely only on energy they stored before migrating. Choice A is incorrect because finding that citizen scientists have observed many different types of marine animals feeding alongside the whales would have no bearing on the team\u2019s claim; the behavior of other animals is irrelevant, and without indicating the timing of the observed feeding, the finding wouldn\u2019t reveal whether the whales rely only on previously stored energy or ever take in additional energy during migration.

    "passage": "The Apollo program missions were spaceflights to the moon led by the United States during the 1960s and 1970s during which astronauts collected some samples of the moon\u2019s surface. More recently, China launched the Chang\u2019e 5 mission, which returned additional lunar surface samples.

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the claim about the significance of the Chang\u2019e 5 lunar samples. The table shows the approximate ages of lunar samples from four different missions: three Apollo missions and the Chang\u2019e 5 mission. The Chang\u2019e 5 samples are said to be approximately 2 billion years old, while the Apollo samples are each said to be more than 3 billion years old. In other words, based on the data in the table, the Chang\u2019e 5 samples are much younger than those from the Apollo missions. Choice B is incorrect because the table shows that the Chang\u2019e 5 samples were taken from a landing site at Oceanus Procellarum, which none of the Apollo missions are shown to have visited. Choice C is incorrect because the table shows the Apollo 17 samples as approximately 3.8 billion years old, the Apollo 15 samples as approximately 3.3 billion years old, and the Chang\u2019e 5 samples as approximately 2 billion years old, and therefore, the Chang\u2019e samples are closer in age to the Apollo 15 samples than they are to the Apollo 17 samples.

    "passage": "In countries with right-hand traffic, drivers who want to make a left turn at a traffic intersection with stoplights have to wait for either a gap in oncoming traffic or a designated left-turn signal to turn green. At busy intersections, this often causes a backup of vehicles waiting to turn left or being prevented from proceeding by left-turning vehicles in front of them. Transportation researcher Vikash V. Gayah claims that in urban areas eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections\u2014both with and without dedicated left-turn signals\u2014would improve traffic flow and, as a result, reduce overall travel times even if such a restriction would require drivers to sometimes travel a slightly longer distance.",

      "D) Statistics reveal that school buses in a city that eliminated left turns at most intersections took on average two minutes longer to complete their routes after the restriction took effect than they did before."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Vikash V. Gayah\u2019s claim that eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections would improve traffic flow and reduce overall travel times. The text begins by describing a problem encountered by drivers in countries with right-hand traffic\u2014namely that drivers wanting to make a left turn must wait for either gaps in oncoming traffic or for designated left-turn signals before proceeding. The resulting backup of vehicles causes increased traffic congestion at busy intersections that slows overall travel times. According to Gayah, eliminating left turns from busy intersections in urban areas would ease the congestion caused by vehicles waiting to turn left. If vehicles spend less time waiting at intersections for left turns, faster overall travel times would result even if some drivers would have to drive slightly longer distances to make the desired left turn. Drivers for package-delivery companies, who presumably spend most of the day driving to destinations across the city in which they are based, would likely provide a good indication of overall traffic patterns across the city. A finding that after a city had eliminated left turns at busy intersections, package-delivery companies were able to complete more daily deliveries on average\u2014which implies faster travel times between package destinations\u2014would therefore support the claim that overall travel times would decrease if left turns were eliminated at busy intersections. Choice A is incorrect because a finding that a majority of survey respondents agreed with the statement that implementing left-turn signals at all busy intersections made navigating streets in their communities easier wouldn\u2019t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether at some busy intersections\u2014both with and without dedicated left-turn signals\u2014would improve the flow of traffic and overall traffic times. In fact, the text emphasizes that designated left-turn signals contribute to increased congestion because they require drivers to wait to turn left, which results in a backup of vehicles. Installing such signals at all busy intersections would thus potentially compound the problem of congestion, not improve it. Moreover, although making streets easier for drivers to navigate might indicate that left-turn signals are beneficial to drivers, it doesn\u2019t indicate that overall travel times would necessarily be reduced. Choice B is incorrect because a study concluding that drivers wait longer to make left turns at intersections without dedicated left-turn signals than at intersections with such signals wouldn\u2019t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether would reduce overall travel times. In fact, the finding would merely support the idea that installing left-turn signals would likely reduce the time drivers spend waiting at busy intersections that didn\u2019t previously have left-turn signals, not that overall travel times would be reduced. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that after a restriction eliminating left turns at most intersections took effect, school buses took longer to complete their routes than they did before the restriction was implemented would contradict rather than support the researcher\u2019s claim that eliminating left turns would reduce overall travel times.",

University of Texas climate scientist Geeta Persad and her colleagues simulated how the amount of water entering aquifers and the amount being used for irrigation purposes would change if this were to occur. Persad and her colleagues concluded that concentration of precipitation into fewer events would result in a higher number of dry days, triggering more irrigation, but that this change in irrigation output is highly sensitive to the baseline concentration of precipitation that currently exists in an area.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support Persad and her colleagues\u2019 conclusion. The text explains that, according to some climate models, precipitation in the western United States will become concentrated into fewer, more intense rain and snow events. According to the text, Persad and her colleagues concluded that more irrigation will consequently be needed but that the change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to, or greatly affected by, the baseline concentration of precipitation in an area. This conclusion is supported by data from the researchers\u2019 simulations of changes in annual irrigation output in two different scenarios\u2014one in which an area\u2019s annual precipitation is already somewhat concentrated and one in which its annual precipitation is evenly distributed. The table shows that if baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will increase only slightly, whereas if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed, water use for irrigation will increase much more\u20149.0% for surface water and 7.9% for groundwater. This difference illustrates the researchers\u2019 conclusion that the amount of additional water needed for irrigation will vary greatly depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is. Choice A is incorrect because it compares changes in the amount of water being used for irrigation to changes in the amount of water entering aquifers. Persad and her colleagues\u2019 conclusion doesn\u2019t focus on changes to the amount of water entering aquifers; rather, the researchers\u2019 conclusion focuses on changes to irrigation output relative to how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area is. Choice C is incorrect because it supports only part of Persad and her colleagues\u2019 conclusion. According to the text, the researchers concluded that the concentration of precipitation into fewer events will trigger more irrigation but that this change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to an area\u2019s baseline concentration of annual precipitation. The data in this choice support the idea that more irrigation will be needed, but to support the rest of the researchers\u2019 conclusion, additional data from the table are required to show that the increases in water use for irrigation will vary depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is.

According to the text, Jia Hu and colleagues \"hypothesized that workplace leaders who reflect on lessons learned from past mistakes are likely to exhibit more humility than leaders who don\u2019t engage in such reflection.\" The bar graph shows the humility scores for managers who participated in Jia Hu and colleagues\u2019 study. It shows average humility scores for managers who reflected on a past mistake that they learned from, managers who reflected on a past mistake that they didn\u2019t learn from, and managers who were in the control group that, according to the text, simply reflected on their daily routines. The graph shows that managers who reflected on a past mistake they learned from received an average humility score between 3.0 and 3.5. Both the control group and managers who reflected on a mistake they didn\u2019t learn from received a lower average humility score of between 2.5 and 3.0. Thus, the managers who reflected on a past mistake that resulted in learning exhibited more humility on average than the managers in the other two groups did. This supports the researchers\u2019 conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct. Choice A is incorrect. Although according to the graph it\u2019s true that none of the group\u2019s humility scores exceeded 3.5, this idea does not support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that their initial hypothesis was correct. The statement that none of the three groups\u2019 average humility scores exceeded 3.5 does not distinguish between those leaders who reflected on lessons learned from past mistakes and those who didn\u2019t, so it would not support Hu and colleagues\u2019 hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility. Choice B is incorrect. While the graph shows that managers in the control group did exhibit less humility than the experimental group of managers who reflected on a mistake they learned from, the graph also shows that the control group exhibited more (not less) humility than the experimental group that reflected on a mistake they didn\u2019t learn from. Furthermore, the idea that the managers in the control group exhibited only slightly less humility on average than the managers in the two experimental groups did would not support the researchers\u2019 conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct.

    "question": "Which quotation from \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    "passage": "\u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d is an 1892 short story by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. In the story, the narrator expresses mixed feelings about her surroundings:______blank",
    "choices": [
      "A) \u201cThis wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then.\u201d",
      "B) \u201cBy moonlight\u2014the moon shines in all night when there is a moon\u2014I wouldn\u2019t know it was the same paper.\u201d",
      "C) \u201cI\u2019m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid [wall]paper.\u201d",
      "D) \u201cThe color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\u201d"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that the narrator of \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" has mixed feelings about her surroundings. She says she is \"really getting quite fond of the big room,\" a positive sentiment, but also describes the room\u2019s wallpaper as \"horrid,\" a negative sentiment. Since some of her feelings about her surroundings are positive and others are negative, they are best described as mixed. Choice A is incorrect because though the narrator describes the room\u2019s wallpaper as \"irritating,\" a negative sentiment, she does not mention a positive sentiment. Thus, the quotation does not effectively illustrate the claim that the narrator has mixed feelings about her surroundings. Choice B is incorrect because it describes how the appearance of the room\u2019s wallpaper changes at night but does not mention the narrator\u2019s feelings about her surroundings. Choice D is incorrect because though the narrator describes the room\u2019s wallpaper as \"repellant,\" a negative sentiment, she does not mention a positive sentiment. Thus, the quotation does not effectively illustrate the claim that the narrator has mixed feelings about her surroundings.",

    "question": "Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement?",
    "passage": "A student in Hawaii is interested in pursuing a career in technology and decides to do some research on local trends. The student notices that the number of jobs in computer services in 2010 was______blank",
    "choices": [
      "A) higher than the number of jobs in technical consulting services, and in 2019 was about the same as the number of jobs in engineering services.",
      "B) about the same as the number of jobs in engineering services, and in 2019 was about the same as the number of jobs in technical consulting services.",
      "C) lower than the number of jobs in engineering services, but in 2019 was higher than the number of jobs in engineering services.",
      "D) about the same as the number of jobs in technical consulting services, but in 2019 was lower than the number of jobs in technical consulting services."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively complete the statement regarding what the student notices about the number of jobs in computer services in 2010. The graph shows that in 2010, the number of computer services jobs was approximately 6,000, which is the same approximate number of jobs in engineering services. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of jobs in technical consulting services and the number of jobs in computer services were about the same, at approximately 5,000. Choice A is incorrect. While the graph shows that in 2010 the number of computer services jobs (about 6,000) was higher than the number of  technical consulting services jobs (about 4,000), in 2019 the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not about the same as the number of engineering services jobs (about 6,000). Choice C is incorrect because according to the graph, the number of jobs in computer services was lower than the number of jobs in engineering services in 2019, not 2010. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not higher than the number of jobs in engineering services (about 6,000). Choice D is incorrect because the graph shows that the number of computer services jobs was about the same as the number of technical consulting services jobs in 2019, not 2010. This also means the number of computer services jobs could not have been lower than the technical consulting services jobs in 2019 if they were about the same.",

    "passage": "Participative pricing, in which purchasers choose the prices they pay for products, can enable sellers to capitalize on the heterogeneous values consumers assign to the same goods and services, but doing so requires careful messaging. Annie Peng Cui and Jennifer Wiggins recruited 171 participants (ages 18\u201360) online for an initial study and 83 students (ages 18\u201331) at a state university for a second study to test the effect of three different messages\u2014\u201cpay what you can,\u201d \u201cpay what you think it\u2019s worth,\u201d and \u201cpay what you want\u201d\u2014on how much participants would pay for concert tickets. Their results illustrate both the heterogeneity of consumer valuations and how sellers can benefit by prompting consumers to consider their own valuations:______blank",
    "choices": [
      "A) the students tended to value the concert tickets more highly than did the more age-diverse group recruited online, but when considering what they could afford to pay, the students tended to choose a lower price than did the other group.",
      "B) in all three messaging conditions, the group of participants recruited online tended to choose lower prices than did the students, but both groups tended to choose prices closest to the actual cost of the tickets when prompted to consider the tickets\u2019 value.",
      "C) the students tended to value the concert tickets more highly than did the more age-diverse group recruited online, but both groups tended to choose a higher price when considering the value of the tickets than when considering what they could afford or wanted to pay.",
      "D) within each group of participants, there was wide variation in the value that individuals assigned to the concert tickets, but the students tended to assign a higher value to the tickets than did the more age-diverse group recruited online."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text about the effect of messaging on participative pricing. The graph shows mean ticket prices chosen by participants in response to three messages across two studies: Study 1, which the text indicates was conducted with an age-diverse group recruited online, and Study 2, which was conducted with student participants. The graph indicates that in the \"pay what you think it\u2019s worth\" condition, the mean price of the concert tickets in Study 2 was about $74, which is greater than the mean price of about $55 in Study 1. In other words, when participants were asked to consider their valuation of the tickets, the response was heterogeneous, or mixed. Moreover, according to the graph, both Study 1 and Study 2 show higher prices for the tickets under the \"pay what you think it\u2019s worth\" condition than they do under both the \"pay what you can\" and the \"pay what you want\" conditions. That is, the data suggest that both groups of participants named higher prices when considering the value of the tickets than when considering either what they could afford or wanted to pay, a finding that supports the idea that sellers can benefit when prompting consumers to consider their own valuations when they choose prices. Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts information in the graph. Although the graph shows that students in Study 2 assigned a higher value to the tickets than did the age-diverse group in Study 1, which would support the idea that consumer valuations were heterogeneous, the graph shows that in the \"pay what you can\" (i.e., what you can afford) condition, the students in Study 2 assigned a higher price (about $40), not a lower price, than the age-diverse group in Study 1 did (about $30). Moreover, even if it were true that the students had assigned a lower price in this condition, it wouldn\u2019t support the result described in the text, only that the participants across the two studies had different ideas of what they can afford to pay. Choice B is incorrect. Although a finding that participants tended to choose prices that were closest to the actual ticket costs in the \"pay what you think it\u2019s worth\" condition would support the idea that sellers benefit by prompting consumers to think about their own valuations (since it\u2019s implied that sellers would lose money in the other conditions, where chosen prices were lower than the participants\u2019 valuations), neither the text nor the graph addresses how any of the prices chosen by the study participants relate to the tickets\u2019 actual market price. Choice D is incorrect. Although the wide variation in participant valuations would support the idea that consumer valuations tend to be heterogeneous, neither the text nor the graph provides any information from which to discern the relative levels of variance among the responses from participants in either study.",

    "passage": "Gorgets, or necklaces with large pendants, have been part of the ceremonial attire of tribes from the US Southeast for centuries. One of the oldest examples, the Fairfield Gorget, was found in Fairfield, Missouri, in 1958. Its overall design resembles that of other art from the region during the Mississippian period (900\u20131600 CE). Yet the image on the gorget is of a jaguar\u2014a species whose range doesn\u2019t extend to Missouri. Jaguar images are common in ancient Mexican art, and Mexico lies squarely in the species\u2019 range. Therefore, some scholars argue thatlong-distance trade in Mexican art objects brought the imagery to Missouri, where a local artist could have adopted it and incorporated it into the Fairfield Gorget.",
    "choices": [
      "A) The Fairfield Gorget is dated not to the Mississippian period but instead to the earlier Woodland period, which ended around 900 CE.",
      "B) The range of the jaguar is shown to have expanded dramatically after the Mississippian period came to a close around 1600 CE.",

      "D) Certain works by present-day artists from Southeastern tribes reflect outside cultural influences, including contemporary Mexican art."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation that the jaguar imagery on the Fairfield Gorget could have been inspired by art objects brought to Missouri from Mexico. The text describes the Fairfield Gorget as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it\u2019s similar to other art from the Mississippian period except for its image of a jaguar. The text goes on to explain that this is unusual because the jaguar\u2019s range didn\u2019t include Missouri. The Fairfield Gorget\u2019s artist likely wouldn\u2019t have encountered a live jaguar, but since such jaguar images were common in ancient Mexican art (and the jaguar\u2019s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that art inspired the gorget\u2019s artist. Therefore, evidence that an ancient Mexican art object had been found at a site that was close to the Fairfield Gorget in both location and time period would strongly support the explanation that long-distance trade from Mexico took place during the Mississippian period and that jaguar imagery could have reached Missouri by those means. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican artistic influence preceded the creation of the Fairfield Gorget. An artifact from Mexico that appeared in Missouri only after the gorget was created cannot support such a claim. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to whether the jaguar image on the Fairfield Gorget was suggested to the Mississippian artist who made it by encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican art. The appearance of jaguars in Missouri after the Mississippian period cannot provide evidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to influence that Mexican art might have had on Mississippian art, restricted to the period from 900 CE to 1600 CE. The actions of contemporary artists cannot provide evidence for centuries-old networks of artistic influence and exchange.",

The program captured 27 wild condors in 1987 in order to protect and breed them. Captive birds have been reintroduced into the wild since 1992.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the biologists\u2019 claim. The text accompanying the graph describes the efforts of the California Condor Recovery Program, which is working to protect the condor from extinction. The program captured some condors in 1987 in order to breed them and has been reintroducing captive birds into the wild since 1992. Many biologists claim the program has been a success, as the text explains, and it is reasonable to infer that an indication of the program\u2019s success would be an increase in the wild condor population compared to the captive condor population. The graph shows the wild and captive condor populations in California between 2014 and 2020. In 2014 there were slightly more than 200 wild condors in California, but by 2020 there were more than 300. Meanwhile, over the same period the captive condor population remained under 200. Thus, the biologists\u2019 claim about the program\u2019s success is supported by data from the graph showing that the number of wild California condors increased overall from 2014 to 2020 and exceeded the number of those living in captivity. Choice A is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The number of captive California condors did not steadily decrease between 2014 and 2020: rather, it increased slightly during some years and decreased slightly during others, generally remaining at slightly less than 200. Choice B is incorrect. Even though the graph does show a slight decrease in both the captive and wild condor populations from 2019 to 2020, such a decrease during a particular year would not demonstrate the program\u2019s success. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The difference between the number of captive and wild California condors did not remain relatively steady between 2014 and 2017. While the number of captive condors remained roughly the same during that period, the number of wild condors increased, so the difference between the number of captive and wild condors increased as well.",

In the quotation, the speaker suggests that one might read poetry with \"contempt,\" or disdain, for it, but even with this negative attitude one will find \"a place for the genuine.\" Because the quotation expresses conflicting attitudes toward poetry, it effectively illustrates the speaker\u2019s ambivalence in discussing the merits and displeasure of reading poetry. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t mention poetry or show ambivalence. Choice B is incorrect. Although the idea of \"half poets\" may seem to relate to ambivalence, the speaker mentions only negative attitudes toward certain works and the quotation therefore lacks a contrasting positive or neutral attitude that would be needed to indicate ambivalence. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker mentions only negative attitudes toward certain works and the quotation therefore lacks a contrasting positive or neutral attitude that would be needed to indicate ambivalence.",

    "question": "Which statement, if true, would most strongly support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues about the cause of \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s acceleration?",
    "passage": "Initially observed in 2017, the interstellar object \u2018Oumuamua is the first object of its kind to be seen in our solar system. Researchers have been puzzled because its acceleration cannot be entirely explained by the gravitational pull of nearby bodies: there must be a nongravitational influence on its velocity and trajectory. Some previously suggested explanations for this nongravitational acceleration involve mechanisms that are unlikely or unrealistic, such as geometric effects from \u2018Oumuamua being potentially composed of several spatially separated bodies. Now, Jennifer Bergner and colleagues propose that the nongravitational acceleration is due to the gaseous expulsion of entrapped hydrogen from \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s water-rich icy body.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Existing proposed models of outgassing from \u2018Oumuamua include the direct conversion of nitrogen or carbon monoxide from a solid to a gaseous state without becoming liquid, but these models have theoretical or observational inconsistencies.",
      "B) \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration that would be caused by the release of hydrogen gas resulting from the processing of water ice (H2O), but the interstellar object\u2019s observable properties can be explained if it has a significant component of molecular hydrogen ice (H2).",
      "C) Since nongravitational accelerations of interstellar objects are several orders of magnitude weaker than gravitational accelerations, deviation from behavior that could be fully attributed to gravitational pull has been detected on a limited number of objects similar to \u2018Oumuamua.",
      "D) Exposure to interstellar cosmic radiation can result in the formation of embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice; moreover, when traveling through the solar system, \u2018Oumuamua experienced warming sufficient to alter its icy structure and allow for outgassing."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents findings that, if true, would support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of \u2018Oumuamua is due to the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen. The text first introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named \u2018Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within \u2018Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: \u2018Oumuamua experienced sufficient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues\u2019 claim. Choice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from \u2018Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of \u2018Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner\u2019s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to \u2018Oumuamua, but the text states that \u2018Oumuamua is the first observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available.",

Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and colleagues modeled the radial growth of the trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate scenarios (the current climate, moderate change, and extreme change). Although they found that climate change would negatively affect growth, they concluded that anthropogenic nitrogen deposition could more than offset that effect provided that change is moderate rather than extreme.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Growth with nitrogen under the current climate exceeded growth with nitrogen under moderate change, but the latter exceeded growth without nitrogen under extreme change.",
      "B) Growth without nitrogen under the current climate exceeded growth without nitrogen under moderate change, but the latter exceeded growth with nitrogen under extreme change.",
      "C) Growth with nitrogen under moderate change exceeded growth without nitrogen under moderate change, but the latter exceeded growth without nitrogen under extreme change.",
      "D) Growth with nitrogen under moderate change exceeded growth without nitrogen under the current climate, but the latter exceeded growth with nitrogen under extreme change."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition can compensate for the negative effect of climate change on tree growth if that change is moderate but not if it\u2019s extreme. The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers\u2019 conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization. Choice A is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn\u2019t support Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of anthropogenic nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it\u2019s extreme. To support this would require comparing radial growth without nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under both moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth with nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions and moderate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under an extreme change, which don\u2019t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice B is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn\u2019t support Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it\u2019s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth under current climate conditions without nitrogen fertilization to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth without nitrogen fertilization under current conditions and moderate change and growth with nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don\u2019t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice C is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn\u2019t support Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it\u2019s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth without adding nitrogen under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only the growth with and without nitrogen fertilization under moderate climate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don\u2019t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change.",

For each candidate species, the table lists its common name, scientific name, and when the species became extinct. The text explains that scientists pursing de-extinction for the candidate species also consider the length of time that has passed since the species\u2019 extinction, noting that the longer the animal has been extinct, the less likely it is that a suitable habitat would exist for the species today. The possibility of not having a suitable habitat would be especially concerning for the candidate species for which the most time has passed since its extinction. According to the table this species would be the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct 11,000 years before present. Choice A is incorrect because it compares the time since the extinction of the passenger pigeon to the time since the extinction of the huia instead of citing the species listed in the table that has been extinct the longest (the saber-toothed cat). The text indicates that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat exists for it today. Neither the table nor the text supports the claim that the passenger pigeon is especially vulnerable to this problem. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the less likely it is that there would be a suitable habitat available for the species today. So, the problem would be especially concerning for the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct several thousand years before the woolly mammoth did\u2014not the other way around.

      "A) In 2016, the number of cellular and molecular biology topic submissions was the same as the number of animal science topic submissions.",
      "B) In 2019, there were more physics and space science topic submissions than there were medicine and health topic submissions.",
      "C) The lowest number of animal science topic submissions in a year was approximately 95 in 2016.",
      "D) The highest number of medicine and health topic submissions during the period shown is approximately 285 in 2019."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to support the underlined claim that more medicine and health topics were submitted to a national science fair in 2019 than in any of the other years shown. This choice indicates that the approximately 285 medicine and health topics submitted in 2019 are more than the number of medicine and health submissions in any other year shown\u2014a description that is supported by information in the graph, which shows that medicine and health topic submissions were below 250 in 2016, 2017, and 2018, but above 250 (approximately 285 submissions) in 2019. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t support the underlined claim or accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice refers to 2016 and discusses cellular and molecular biology and animal science, whereas the underlined claim refers to 2019 and discusses medicine and health. Moreover, the claim that in 2016 there were equal numbers of submissions in the cellular and molecular biology category and in the animal science category is contradicted by the graph, which shows approximately 200 submissions and 50 submissions, respectively, for those categories in 2016. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice claims that in 2019 there were more physics and space submissions than there were medicine and health submissions, but the graph shows that there were approximately 100 space and science submissions that year and approximately 285 medicine and health submissions. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the information in the graph or support the underlined claim about medicine and health research topics. This choice claims that there were approximately 95 submissions for the animal science category in 2016, but the graph shows that the number was closer to 50 in 2016.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",

In the quotation, it says the young woman\u2019s \"first feeling was of disappointment\" and that \"there was little claim to beauty\" when referring to the house. This disappointment and the overall lack of beauty in the house suggest that the young woman isn\u2019t impressed by the house she is visiting. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn\u2019t describe what the young woman thinks about the house. Instead, it indicates that there is more light because window blinds have been opened. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation describes a door and a path outside of the house but doesn\u2019t include anything to indicate the young woman\u2019s feelings about the house. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation states what the young woman did in the house (\"tip-toed through the hall\" and \"opened the door\"), but it doesn\u2019t show what she thinks about it.",

The text states that the values are on a scale from 0.25 (less impact) to 1.00 (greater impact). The table shows that the value for the estimated impact of invasive mongooses on threatened mammals is 0.75. Choice A is incorrect because the table shows that the value for the estimated impact of mongooses on threatened mammals is 0.75, not 0.35. The value 0.35 is not assigned to any of the categories in the table. Choice B is incorrect because the table shows that 0.61 is the value for the estimated impact of cats, not mongooses, on threatened mammals.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from \"The Bet\" to illustrate the claim that the banker was very upset about something. The quotation indicates that the banker shed tears, which suggests that he was likely unhappy about something, and that his emotions were so strong that they kept him from sleeping for hours. These details suggest that the banker was very upset. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation mainly describes the banker cautiously unlocking a door; it doesn\u2019t suggest that he was particularly upset about anything. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn\u2019t mention whether the banker was experiencing any particularly strong negative feelings; instead, the quotation focuses on the quietness of the setting.

      "D) experts in English history tend to prefer Shakespeare\u2019s history plays to his other works."

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the relative appeal of different kinds of plays by Shakespeare to today\u2019s audiences. According to the text, Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies address broad themes that continue to appeal to today\u2019s audiences. Indeed, the text suggests that these themes are timeless, as illustrated by the example of Romeo and Juliet, which the text states is still read and widely performed despite being set in the Italy of Shakespeare\u2019s time. In contrast, the text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand Shakespeare\u2019s history plays. Because many theatergoers and readers are unlikely to possess such extensive historical knowledge, it follows that they are likely to find Shakespeare\u2019s history plays less engaging than his more accessible tragedies. Choice B is incorrect because the text never introduces a comparison between Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies and twentieth-century plays, only between Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies and his history plays. Since twentieth-century plays aren\u2019t mentioned, there\u2019s no basis in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today\u2019s audiences. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Romeo and Juliet is thematically accessible to today\u2019s audiences, it doesn\u2019t suggest that Romeo and Juliet is more accessible than Shakespeare\u2019s other tragedies. Rather, the text presents Romeo and Juliet as an example to support the idea that Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies hold continued appeal for today\u2019s readers and theatergoers. Choice D is incorrect. Although experts in English history would likely possess the knowledge needed to understand Shakespeare\u2019s history plays, the text never mentions such experts or suggests that they would enjoy the history plays more than Shakespeare\u2019s other works.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Euro-American farmers\u2019 use of Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques. According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in the early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts might be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the Haudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn\u2019t learn these techniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn\u2019t invent the techniques independently, then the most logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly influenced by Haudenosaunee practices than the farmers themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural practices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those practices to their own farming. Choice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the crops typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers\u2019 crops were ill suited to the techniques, it\u2019s unlikely that the farmers would have used those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates only that Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques were used by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States, not that these techniques were widely used outside this region.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some Euro-American farmers were using Haudenosaunee farming techniques early in the nineteenth century. This suggests that some Euro-American farmers were beginning to recognize the benefits of these techniques near the start of the century, not that such farmers only began to recognize the benefits of the techniques much later.",

Although the text presents research findings that suggest some workplace interruptions can have a positive effect on employee job satisfaction, no further information is presented to suggest at what frequency these interruptions are ideal. Furthermore, the text doesn\u2019t tie workplace interruptions to increased productivity, but rather links it to social benefits such as sense of belonging. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address employees\u2019 motives for choosing not to interrupt their colleagues. The text presents research findings that suggest that there are some positive interpersonal effects of workplace interruptions that can increase employee job satisfaction. Choice D is incorrect because asking businesses to discourage workplace interruptions doesn\u2019t follow from the team\u2019s research about the benefits of workplace interruptions, nor does the text describe an ideal work environment. Instead, the text presents research suggesting that there may be positive aspects to workplace interruptions that haven\u2019t previously been considered.",

According to the text, one potential explanation for humans walking upright on two legs is that the behavior evolved from an ancestor that mostly stayed on the ground and walked on four limbs, as modern chimpanzees and gorillas do. However, the finding that orangutans, also a relative of humans, sometimes stand on two legs in trees while using their arms to balance and reach for fruits suggests another possible explanation: perhaps a tree-dwelling ancestor of humans began moving on two legs because it offered an advantage, such as access to certain foods. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that modern orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn\u2019t offer any insight into when either bipedalism or tree-climbing behavior emerged in human ancestors. Additionally, the text indicates that one theory is that bipedalism evolved from a mostly ground-based ancestor that was already practicing knuckle-walking, not that bipedalism and knuckle-walking developed at the same time.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of scholars\u2019 understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn\u2019t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don\u2019t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn\u2019t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn\u2019t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn\u2019t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars\u2019 mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren\u2019t very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn\u2019t have marketplaces, it wouldn\u2019t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don\u2019t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn\u2019t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn\u2019t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn\u2019t have any need for marketplaces.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of A. mexicanus. According to the text, A. mexicanus, a river-dwelling fish species, has colonized caves. The fish that live in rivers and those that live in caves show no significant genetic differences and are all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates, however, that Hyacinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the river fish use in a particular context and for a particular purpose are used in a different context and for a different purpose by the cave fish. Additionally, the sounds made by cave fish show some differences depending on the specific cave the fish inhabit. The text goes on to state that Hyacinthe and colleagues have noted that differences in how the fish use sound to communicate could eventually become so great that they prevent fish from different locations from interbreeding. In other words, the river fish might eventually only breed with other river fish (with whom they share characteristics regarding sonic communication that they do not share with cave fish), while the cave fish might only breed with other cave fish for a similar reason. In context, this observation suggests that even though the fish are a single species right now, they could be in the process of splitting into distinct populations with different characteristics. Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text suggesting that the river fish are less reliant on sonic communication than the cave fish are. Although the text does indicate that the river fish and cave fish are genetically similar, the text describes both groups as using sonic communication and says nothing to indicate that one group depends on that communication more than the other group does. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that all members of the species can emit the same sounds but that the function and context of sounds differ depending on whether the fish live in rivers or caves, but it does not indicate that river fish produce sounds that cave fish do not or vice versa.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the text. The text says that there is little genetic difference between the river fish and the cave fish, not that the river fish and cave fish are so genetically distinct that they can be considered separate species.",

New Mexico was so distant from population centers in Spain\u2019s other colonies that it attracted few colonists after its initial colonization.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it is the choice that most logically completes the text. The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in New Mexico, which was colonized by Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain\u2019s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony\u2019s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that geographical isolation can influence how a language develops. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses different dialects of Spanish, not different languages altogether. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on how the New Mexican dialect has stayed the same over time in some ways, not on how it has changed from one generation to the next. Choice D is incorrect because though the text discusses how the New Mexican dialect of Spanish is different from others, it does not discuss how speakers of different dialects are able to understand each other.",

If it were true both that Kuulo Kataa was founded in the fourteenth century CE and that artifacts found in excavations of the settlement are from the thirteenth century CE, it would be reasonable to conclude that the artifacts weren\u2019t created in the Kuulo Kataa settlement. That would suggest, then, that the artifacts originated somewhere else and eventually reached the settlement through trading or as people migrated. Choice A is incorrect because the existence of thirteenth-century CE artifacts recovered during excavations of a settlement founded in the fourteenth century CE isn\u2019t logically connected to artifacts from one century being more commonly recovered than artifacts from another century. Rather than suggesting anything about how frequently artifacts from different times are found, the existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the settlement\u2019s founding suggests that those items arrived in Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on time periods and says nothing about which region the founders of Kuulo Kataa have been thought to come from; similarly, the text doesn\u2019t suggest anything about where the thirteenth-century CE artifacts originated other than not from Kuulo Kataa. Therefore, it isn\u2019t logical to conclude that the mere existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the Kuulo Kataa settlement suggests that the founders of the settlement came from a particular region other than one previously assumed.

The text states that Indigenous cultures possess special knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants, which is reflected in their vocabulary.

Given that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as repositories of knowledge about plants\u2019 medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations\u2019 lands.

In 2021, a team including conservators Marie-France Lemay and Paula Zyats and materials scientist Anik\u00f3 Bezur performed an extensive analysis of the map and the ink used.

The text indicates that while some scholars have believed that the map was drawn in the mid-1400s, the 2021 analysis showed the presence of the compound titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the map. The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn\u2019t used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn\u2019t have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn\u2019t have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn\u2019t have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers. Choice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn\u2019t available until the early 1900s doesn\u2019t imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn\u2019t have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding suggests that the map couldn\u2019t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn\u2019t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge\u2014and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers\u2014of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn\u2019t used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn\u2019t have been created in the mid-1400s. Choice D is incorrect because although the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for the creation of the ink that was used to draw the Vinland Map, the text does say that titanium dioxide was introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than the early 1900s.

The text states that the two samples of plants showed no difference in flowering at 22\u00b0 Celsius, but at 27\u00b0 Celsius the unaltered plants with ELF3 showed accelerated flowering while the plants without ELF3 didn\u2019t. If accelerated flowering at the higher temperature occurred in the A. thaliana plants with ELF3 but not in the plants without the protein, then ELF3 likely enables A. thaliana to respond to increased temperatures. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention whether any plants other than A. thaliana and stiff brome show temperature-sensitive flowering, so there is no support for the idea that this type of flowering is unique to A. thaliana. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the effects of ELF3 and not the production of it. There\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the amount of ELF3 in A. thaliana\u00a0varies with temperature. Choice D is incorrect. While the text states that there was no difference in the flowering of modified and unmodified A. thaliana plants at 22\u00b0 Celsius, there\u2019s no suggestion that A. thaliana only begins to flower at 22\u00b0 Celsius; the text doesn\u2019t mention a specific temperature threshold required for A. thaliana flowering.",

The text begins by stating that the simulations led the researchers to conclude that the solar system likely formed from three giant dust rings that encircled the Sun. The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring\u2014that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth\u2019s real size, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring\u2019s formation was important in determining Earth\u2019s eventual size. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text explains that when the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring in one simulation, the size of the innermost planets was affected (which suggests that the middle ring likely formed earlier than it did in this simulation), the text doesn\u2019t indicate that this was an initial simulation\u2014that is, a simulation that was conducted before other simulations. Moreover, the text makes no reference to the specific results of any other simulations; therefore, there is no basis for comparing any conclusions based on the simulation in which the middle ring\u2019s formation was delayed with conclusions based on other simulations. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the formation of the middle ring, not the outermost ring, affected the four innermost planets\u2019 eventual size in the researchers\u2019 simulation; therefore, the simulation offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost ring\u2019s formation affected the size of the planets.

Recent analysis comparing turkey remains at Mesa Verde, one such village in southern Colorado, to samples from modern turkey populations in the Rio Grande Valley of north central New Mexico determined that the latter birds descended in part from turkeys cultivated at Mesa Verde, with shared genetic markers appearing only after 1280.

The text states that in the late 1200s C.E., the Ancestral Puebloan civilization abandoned villages in its original homeland, which included the Mesa Verde site. The text goes on to say that recent genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande Valley descends partly from the ancient turkeys raised at Mesa Verde, and that the genetic markers shared by the two turkey populations first appeared at Mesa Verde only after 1280 C.E. Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried their agricultural practices\u2014including the farming of turkeys\u2014to their new home.

However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven\u2019t consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren\u2019t necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager\u2019s appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird\u2019s overall fitness. Choice A is incorrect because Shultz\u2019s finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because Shultz\u2019s finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers\u2019 feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness. Whether the signal of fitness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how effective the signal is: a signal is effective if potential mates behave as though it\u2019s true, regardless of whether it\u2019s actually true.

The text indicates that newborn animals of some species are attracted to faces and to stimuli that resemble faces. These species, the text says, share two characteristics: they\u2019re social and they practice parental care, meaning that parents care for their young. The text goes on to describe Versace and colleagues\u2019 experiment, which showed that Testudo tortoises, which aren\u2019t social and don\u2019t practice parental care, were attracted to a stimulus that resembles a face. Since Versace and colleagues have shown that a species that isn\u2019t social and doesn\u2019t practice parental care nevertheless has the innate characteristic of being attracted to face-like stimuli, it follows that this characteristic shouldn\u2019t be assumed to be an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the tortoise hatchlings, which are solitary and don\u2019t practice parental care, were attracted to the face-like stimuli, not that they perceived the stimuli as threatening. Choice C is incorrect because the phenomenon discussed in the text is an attraction to faces and face-like stimuli on the part of newborn animals, which can\u2019t show any learned characteristics since they were just born. Additionally, the text tells us that the tortoises Versace and colleagues studied aren\u2019t social and don\u2019t practice parental care, so any findings about those tortoises wouldn\u2019t be relevant to the question of whether an attraction to faces in social species that practice parental care is innate or learned.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that adult tortoises were tested on face-like stimuli and, if adults were in fact tested, no information about how they responded is provided. Since no information about adult tortoises\u2019 responses is provided, no conclusion comparing those responses to the responses of newly hatched tortoises can be supported.",

The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to active multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes\u2019 antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team\u2019s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes\u2019 antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors.

The text explains that Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel to create the poems in her book. According to the text, the method involves basing a new poem on a line from an existing poem. The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of important Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes\u2019s poems. The text goes on to say that this writing method is difficult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively reviewed Grimes\u2019s book. If the reviewers of One Last Word specifically note that the work is a \u201cbeautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it,\u201d then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden shovel method to pay tribute to other poets. This suggests that Grimes was successful in using the golden shovel method to achieve her goal of honoring Black poets in her book. Choice A is incorrect because the reaction suggests that most reviewers did understand Grimes\u2019s goal for her book. According to the text, the reviewers noted that the poems in her book were a \u201cbeautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it.\u201d Earlier, the text claims that Grimes intended the poems \u201cto honor important Black poets of the past,\u201d so in their praise of her book, the reviewers clearly indicated that they understood Grimes\u2019s goal.

The Sumerians solved this problem by using river water for their farming\u2014as a result, they often harvested more crops than were needed in a season. It follows that the Sumerians must have needed to find something to do with the surplus crops\u2014that is, they stored the extra crops for later use.

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the Sumerians tried to shield their crops from the sun: in fact, the text indicates that the sunny weather helped crops grow very quickly and that the Sumerians used river water to allow crops to be exposed to the sun without dying. Choice C is incorrect. Having a surplus of crops wouldn\u2019t have caused the Sumerians to begin farming until long after 4000 BCE: in fact, since the text indicates that the Sumerian civilization formed around 4000 BCE and farming was a part of that civilization, the statement that Sumerians only began farming long after 4000 BCE isn\u2019t supported by the text.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the sound quality of Cremonese and modern violins. The text states that violins made in Cremona in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries sound superior to modern violins. It then indicates that some experts attribute the difference to different woods being used to make these violins, but both Cremonese and modern violins are made of the same woods (maple and spruce); thus this cannot account for the difference. The text then says that recent analysis suggests the wood in Cremonese violins was chemically treated by the craftspeople who made them, thereby providing an alternate explanation for the sound differences: the chemical alteration that is present in the Cremonese violins but absent from the modern ones. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not discuss how the sound quality of Cremonese violins compares with the sound quality of other instruments made during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin\u2019s sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to \u201cnew analysis,\u201d which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood.",

The text begins by stating that logging practices are often thought of as being contrary to forest conservation efforts. Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on specific forest plots, finding that the plots with limited logging may be \"more robust\" (healthier) than the plots that hadn\u2019t been logged at all. Given these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way. Choice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest management strategy.

Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some financial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn\u2019t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower financial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential financial savings for these participants. Choice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker\u2019s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker\u2019s convenience.

The text first describes what paleontologists initially speculated to be true of T. navigans based on observing only fossilized skulls of the pterosaur rather than complete skeletons\u2014namely, that T. navigans had an oversized head crest and that, like other pterosaurs, its main mode of movement must have been flight. The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of T. navigans, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make T. navigans different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, T. navigans likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought. Choice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that T. navigans would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Therefore, Beccari\u2019s team would not suggest that T. navigans flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari\u2019s team would not suggest that T. navigans had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that T. navigans had a large-crested head.

According to the text, researchers were surprised to find that the tapeworm extends the life of its ant host, rather than reducing it.

The study\u2019s researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than expected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an ant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its life. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected ants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be inferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to compensate for reduced contributions within the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how A. brevis is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected ants are more likely to be directly exposed to A. brevis while caring for infected ants. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the relative abilities of infected and uninfected ants to escape predators: in fact, predators are not mentioned in the text at all. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not supply any information about the average lifespans of the ants in colonies without parasitic activity; the text only indicates factors that lengthen and shorten the lifespans of ants in parasitized colonies.",

The text indicates that the team found several instances of the appendix emerging and not disappearing in the lineages of various mammal species the team examined. Furthermore, the text states that species that possess an appendix also tend to have relatively high amounts of lymphoid tissue\u2014a type of tissue that supports immune system function. Taken together, these details strongly support the hypothesis that the appendix has persisted in some species because it has a function that contributes to effective immune responses in those species. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address any nonmammalian species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t make predictions about the evolutionary future of the species Smith and colleagues examined, and although the implication of the text is that the appendix likely does serve a function for the immune system, nothing in the text indicates that the appendix will become more widespread in the future. Choice D is incorrect.

After stating that many authors still choose to draft novels by hand even though computers are now widely used, the text acknowledges the speculation that the opposite choice\u2014using only a computer\u2014would have had an effect on such novels. However, the text then points out that every novel is the singular result of a combination of the particular conditions surrounding its creation. This suggests that it isn\u2019t possible to determine the effect of any single condition (such as the means of writing) on its own; thus, there would be no way to reasonably evaluate how a novel would have turned out differently if it had been written by other means.

Philosopher L. Sebastian Purcell has shown that surviving works of Aztec (Nahua) philosophy express a very different view. Purcell reveals that these works posit an ethical system in which an individual\u2019s actions are judged in light of how well they accord with the individual\u2019s role in society and how well they contribute to the community. To the extent that these works are representative of Aztec thought, Purcell\u2019s analysis suggests that______blank",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion about Aztec (Nahua) ethics. The text indicates that, according to Purcell\u2019s interpretation of available Aztec philosophical works, the Aztec ethical system views an individual\u2019s actions in relation to that individual\u2019s societal role and how the actions affect the community. The text contrasts this view with another held by some ethicists, namely that actions are morally good or bad regardless of the context in which they occur. Thus, Purcell\u2019s analysis suggests that the Aztecs would have asserted that the morality of an individual\u2019s actions are rooted in that person\u2019s position in the community and the actions\u2019 effects and therefore cannot be determined in the absence of that context. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that morally judging an action according to Aztec ethics requires an understanding of the action\u2019s effects and the individual\u2019s social circumstances, it does not specify that only members of that society can acquire this information. Choice C is incorrect because it implies that the Aztecs considered some actions good or bad regardless of the surrounding context, which contradicts the text\u2019s claim that the Aztecs believed that the morality of an individual\u2019s action is dependent on the action\u2019s effects on the community and the person\u2019s specific circumstances. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that in Aztec ethics the morality of an action depends in part on how it affects the community, this is only one of the two factors\u2014the other being the person\u2019s societal role\u2014that need to be considered.

The text explains that urchin barrens are areas that used to be kelp forests but are now covered by purple sea urchins. The text suggests that because there is no more vegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for many predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea urchins, sunflower sea stars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunflower sea stars didn\u2019t always avoid consuming nutritionally poor urchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunflower sea star populations to grow could help control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor purple sea urchins from barrens. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea urchins, the sunflower sea stars in the study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones.

In fact, the text indicates that the sunflower sea stars in the study did consume sea urchins, feeding on both nutritionally poor and nutritionally rich ones.

Perovskite-only cells thus must convert 22% or less\u2014not more than 29.5%\u2014of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible improvement to photovoltaic cells and makes no mention of any alternatives to those cells, so there is no reason to conclude that photovoltaic cells must be replaced with some other technology. Additionally, the text presents solar power as something that currently exists, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to conclude that solar power will remain elusive. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of other minerals than perovskite. In fact, the text gives no indication that it is even possible to use other minerals than silicon and perovskite in photovoltaic cells. Instead, the text is focused on the effect of combining perovskite and silicon and the different parts of the solar spectrum that perovskite and silicon capture.",

The text first establishes that information coming from credentialed experts typically increases the credibility of that information. However, the text goes on to describe a situation that goes against this expectation: the messages from previous trial volunteers were judged as more credible than the messages from licensed doctors when recruiting clinic trial participants. The text then goes on to speculate as to why this may have been the case, stating that participants likely considered the messages from the former trial volunteers to be more convincing than the messages from the doctors because the former trial volunteers were perceived as having undergone the same experience that the participants were considering. It is reasonable to infer, then, that participants regarded the former trial volunteers\u2019 direct experience as more important to their decision-making than the doctors\u2019 status as credentialed experts. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not provide any indication as to the content or the tone of the messages provided by either the doctors or the former trial volunteers regarding the clinical trials.
