    "question": "Based on the texts, Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?",
    "passage": "Text 1: Microbes are tiny organisms in the soil, water, and air all around us. They thrive even in very harsh conditions. That\u2019s why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn\u2019t seem to contain any life. The finding doesn\u2019t prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes\u2019 survival. Text 2: Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it\u2019s unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer\u2019s team\u2019s study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures.",
      "B) A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site.",
      "C) Microbes are likely difficult to detect in the soil at the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere.",
      "D) Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer\u2019s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer\u2019s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn\u2019t appear to contain any life. Fierer\u2019s team says that though this doesn\u2019t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it\u2019s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer\u2019s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer\u2019s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer\u2019s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn\u2019t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn\u2019t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer\u2019s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them, but the author doesn\u2019t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer\u2019s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples.",

Studying wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres, the team reported that traces of elements such as lithium and sodium support the presence of exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth\u2019s. Text 2: Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have concluded that certain exoplanets had continental crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signifiers of the types of rock found on Earth. The studies don\u2019t adequately account for different minerals made up of various ratios of those elements, and the possibility of rock types not found on Earth that contain those minerals.",

Therefore, Putirka and Xu would likely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium are also found in rocks that are not like Earth\u2019s continental crust. Choice A is incorrect because the texts do not indicate how widely held any of the viewpoints described are.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because neither text discusses how new this area of study is.

    "passage": "Text 1: In a study of the benefits of having free time, Marissa Sharif found that the reported sense of life satisfaction tended to plateau when participants had two hours of free time per day and actually began to fall when they had five hours of free time per day. After further research, Sharif concluded that this dip in life satisfaction mainly occurred when individuals spent all their free time unproductively, such as by watching TV or playing games. Text 2: Psychologist James Maddux cautions against suggesting an ideal amount of free time. The human desire for both free time and productivity is universal, but Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction. Furthermore, he points out that there is no objective definition for what constitutes productivity; reading a book might be considered a productive activity by some, but idleness by others.",

      "D) By claiming that the specific activities named in Text 1 are actually examples of productive activities rather than unproductive ones"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it characterizes how Maddux would most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif reached after her research. Text 1 describes Sharif\u2019s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. \u00a0However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively\u2014that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others.",

    "passage": "Text 1: The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event is usually attributed solely to an asteroid impact near Chicxulub, Mexico. Some scientists argue that ==volcanic activity was the true cause, as the K-Pg event occurred relatively early in a long period of eruption of the Deccan Traps range that initially produced huge amounts of climate-altering gases.== These dissenters note that other mass extinctions have coincided with large volcanic eruptions, while only the K-Pg event lines up with an asteroid strike. Text 2: In a 2020 study, Pincelli Hull and her colleagues analyzed ocean core samples and modeled climate changes around the K-Pg event. The team concluded that Deccan Traps gases did affect global conditions prior to the event, but that the climate returned to normal well before the extinctions began\u2014extinctions that instead closely align with the Chicxulub impact.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes how Hull\u2019s team would most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1, which asserts that volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps range led to changes in the climate and caused the K-Pg mass extinction event. According to Text 2, although Hull\u2019s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the climate before the K-Pg event, the team determined that the climate had returned to normal before mass extinctions began. This finding and the observation that the K-Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub asteroid impact suggest that Hull\u2019s team would likely dispute the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 and say that the climate changes caused by the Deccan Traps activity were not the main cause of the extinctions. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull\u2019s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull\u2019s team would disagree that the Deccan Traps activity caused the K-Pg event. Additionally, the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 says nothing about how the Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull\u2019s team might believe that the impact did in fact change the climate, they could not be said to agree with the claim in Text 1 on this point.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication in either text that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity, so there is no reason to conclude that Hull\u2019s team would question why the scientists referred to in Text 1 make such an assumption.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull\u2019s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull\u2019s team would say that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring effect on global conditions than the scientists referenced in Text 1 believe, not that the effect on global conditions was more significant than those scientists claim.",

An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration. Text 2: When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Text 1 based on the information provided.

Text 1 characterizes this discovery as \u201cespecially promising\u201d and a sign of \u201cexciting progress\u201d in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR\u2019s function in humans isn\u2019t yet known, it\u2019s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1\u2019s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava\u2019s team\u2019s observations about EGR in humans. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven\u2019t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn\u2019t say that Text 1\u2019s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1\u2019s excitement as premature and overly optimistic.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people.

Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues\u2019 evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey\u2019s evidence is. Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from \u201c1321\u20131407 CE\u2014over a century before Europeans invaded the region\u201d and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey\u2019s account in Text 1.

Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens.

Text 1 focuses on the discovery of a strange fossil consisting of the skull of the extinct species Oculudentavis khaungraae. According to Text 1, the fossil has features that appear to be avian, or related to birds, which led researchers to initially think that the fossil might be a very small avian dinosaur. Text 2 begins by noting the discovery of a second fossil similar to the one discussed in Text 1, then explains that based on detailed studies of both fossils, paleontologists think that the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls appeared avian at first. This suggests that the paleontologists in Text 2 recognize that the fossils do indeed look like they could be related to birds. For this reason, the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1\u2014that the fossil was avian\u2014is understandable, even if the fossil is probably not avian but rather is from a lizard. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the fossils initially looked avian, so the paleontologists described in Text 2 wouldn\u2019t be confused by the researchers in Text 1 initially thinking that O. khaungraae might be related to birds. The paleontologists would find that initial thought understandable, not confusing. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 never mentions lizards, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense for the paleontologists in Text 2 to say that the researchers in Text 1 mistakenly assumed that O. khaungraae must be a lizard. Choice D is incorrect. Although the paleontologists in Text 2 might agree that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1 was reasonable, nothing in Text 2 suggests that the two skulls were shaped differently.",

According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues\u2019 perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.

Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn\u2019t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it.

In arguing that graphic novels shouldn\u2019t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"\u2014that is, comparatively very little\u2014in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn\u2019t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel\u2019s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes. Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn\u2019t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there\u2019s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn\u2019t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn\u2019t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn\u2019t imply that graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written\u2014that is, well crafted\u2014as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn\u2019t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted.",

Knowing that cost reductions would expand access to mycoprotein, biochemists are exploring solutions, such as a cheaper substrate to feed the mycoprotein as it grows. Text 2: Cattle farming is a principal cause of global deforestation, and a study by Florian Humpen\u00f6der and his colleagues found that replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of mycoprotein would cut deforestation by half if accomplished over the next thirty years.

The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpen\u00f6der and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people\u2019s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people\u2019s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue.

The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo\u2019s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn\u2019t the only thing that influences flamingos\u2019 coloring. Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn\u2019t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo\u2019s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos\u2019 feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn\u2019t notice a change wouldn\u2019t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo\u2019s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos\u2019 shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn\u2019t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.",

Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old\u2014much older than the Clovis people\u2019s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces\u2014that they are human-made tools\u2014that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence. Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn\u2019t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group\u2019s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn\u2019t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group\u2019s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent\u2019s first inhabitants. Therefore, there\u2019s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.",

    "passage": "Text 1: In 1954 George Balanchine choreographed a production of *The Nutcracker*, a ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage *The Nutcracker* each year. ==But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced.== Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences. Text 2: *The Nutcracker* is outdated, but it should be kept because it\u2019s a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show *Hot Chocolate Nutcracker* combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009.",
    "choices": [
      "A) By questioning the idea that the story of The Nutcracker is stuck in the past and by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version",
      "B) By agreeing that contemporary audiences have largely stopped going to see performances of The Nutcracker because it\u2019s so old-fashioned",
      "C) By pointing out that most dance companies could increase their incomes by offering modernized versions of The Nutcracker",
      "D) By suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by noting the success of The Nutcracker but then claims that the ballet is \"stuck in the past\" and should \"no longer be produced.\" Text 2 begins by conceding that The Nutcracker is indeed outdated but argues that it should continue to be performed, states that the show can be updated to include more contemporary dance styles, and provides an example of one such modernized version, Hot Chocolate Nutcracker. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 advocates for using creative ways to update The Nutcracker and therefore wouldn\u2019t respond to the underlined claim by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version. Choice B is incorrect because although the authors of both texts claim that The Nutcracker is outdated, neither text suggests that contemporary audiences have largely stopped attending productions of the show. On the contrary, Text 2 states that The Nutcracker is a holiday favorite and generates substantial income for some dance companies. Choice C is incorrect because although Text 2 provides an example of a contemporized version of The Nutcracker, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that offering modernized versions is a way to increase income for most dance companies. Rather, the author of Text 2 suggests that offering modernized versions is a way to make the ballet discussed in Text 1 feel less outdated.",

Generally, while characters in computer-animated films appear highly exaggerated, environments and lighting are carefully engineered to mimic reality. But some animators, such as Pixar\u2019s Sanjay Patel, are focused on a different question.

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, \u201cHow lifelike are they?\u201d The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren\u2019t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film\u2019s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films\u2019 unique stories and aren\u2019t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience\u2019s reactions to characters in animated films.",

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren\u2019t certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don\u2019t have enough information about the star\u2019s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse\u2019s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn\u2019t be sufficient.

    "passage": "The following text is from Edith Wharton\u2019s 1905 novel *The House of Mirth*. Lily Bart and a companion are walking through a park. Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the fitting background of her own sensations. ==The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches.== On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there the lingering green of an oak-grove.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be \u201ckeenly sensitive to\u201d scenes that serve as a \u201cfitting background\u201d for her feelings\u2014that is, she\u2019s very aware of when a setting seems to reflect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she\u2019s in as a large-scale reflection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It\u2019s the next sentence that adds specific details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conflict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reflects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reflect her current mood, and that assertion isn\u2019t expanded on in the next sentence. Instead, the next sentence describes specific details of the scene without connecting them to Lily\u2019s feelings.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish that birds of some species don\u2019t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specifically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out finding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise. Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specific behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence\u2019s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn\u2019t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds\u2019 nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it\u2019s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds\u2019 reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they\u2019ve hatched.",

The underlined sentence then describes the data the team consulted and how they were used (comparing predictions about earnings to what the companies actually earned), and the final sentence presents what the team found in their examination of the data. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to explain part of the methodology used in the team\u2019s study. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence explains in part how the team conducted their analysis of the effect of sunshine but doesn\u2019t address what the team found; a broad summary is instead given in the other two sentences.

      "D) To consider how Indigenous politicians in the United States have influenced Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to illustrate two approaches that Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve political representation for their communities. The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplified by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for office who support causes that are important to their communities. Choice A is incorrect because the text\u2019s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn\u2019t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have influenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians\u2019 approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city\u2019s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco\u2019s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn\u2019t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals\u2014or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as \u201ca living showcase of San Francisco\u2019s artistic spirit,\u201d the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.",

    "passage": "For his 1986 album *Keyboard Fantasies*, Beverly Glenn-Copeland wrote songs grounded in traditional soul and folk music, then accompanied them with futuristic synthesizer arrangements featuring ambient sounds and complex rhythms.

The underlined portion of the text mentions two of those musicians, Blood Orange and Moses Sumney, who \u201ccite the album as an influence.\u201d Therefore, the underlined portion of the text offers examples of younger musicians whose work has been impacted by Keyboard Fantasies. Choice A is incorrect because even though the underlined sentence states that Blood Orange and Moses Sumney were influenced by Keyboard Fantasies, it doesn\u2019t say that all other musicians should also embrace the album\u2019s experimental style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Keyboard Fantasies was not admired on its first release, the text doesn\u2019t present any criticism of the album by younger musicians: it only presents two younger musicians who cite it as an influence.

    "passage": "The following text is adapted from *Indian Boyhood*, a 1902 memoir by Ohiyesa (Charles A. Eastman), a Santee Dakota writer. In the text, Ohiyesa recalls how the women in his tribe harvested maple syrup during his childhood. Now the women began to test the trees\u2014moving leisurely among them, axe in hand, and striking a single quick blow, to see if the sap would appear. ==The trees, like people, have their individual characters; some were ready to yield up their life-blood, while others were more reluctant.== Now one of the birchen basins was set under each tree, and a hardwood chip driven deep into the cut which the axe had made.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text\u2019s overall portrayal of how the women in Ohiyesa\u2019s tribe harvested maple syrup. The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple trees in order to find out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap described as the trees\u2019 \u201clife-blood.\u201d Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so. Using personification, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees\u2014their potential to give sap\u2014that the women are evaluating. Choice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence does mention \u201cindividual characters,\u201d this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees, which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence focuses on the trees\u2019 willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the beneficial relationship between the women and the trees. Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benefit from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benefit from this relationship in turn. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence is comparing maple trees to humans, not addressing the influence of the natural environment on how the actual humans in the text, the women, behave.",

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text presents the speaker\u2019s experience of viewing the sea. In the underlined portion, the speaker focuses on the idea that the waves hitting rocks on the shore are a relentless and enduring force: they are constantly pushed back (\u201cever repulsed\u201d) but always return (\u201cever rushing on\u201d), as though they have an energy that can\u2019t be overcome (\u201ca life that will not know defeat\u201d). Choice A is incorrect. Although the underlined portion characterizes the waves as a relentless force (always \u201crepulsed\u201d but still \u201crushing on\u201d and never being defeated), the speaker doesn\u2019t suggest that the surroundings are intimidating.

Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t suggest that the speaker is ambivalent, or has mixed feelings about, the natural world. Instead, it presents a single view of one part of the immediate surroundings: the speaker characterizes the sea\u2019s waves as an unstoppable force, since they are constantly pushed back but always return (\u201cever repulsed, yet ever rushing on\u201d).\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although the text later suggests the speaker\u2019s view of her own thoughts by referring to a \u201cclouded brain\u201d and a heart that leaps joyously, this reference neither occurs within the underlined portion nor establishes a clear contrast with the relentless determination of the waves.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain different ways in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius\u2019s helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood\u2019s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text\u2019s many examples of Julius\u2019s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t portray either the narrator\u2019s or his wife\u2019s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn\u2019t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together. In fact, it\u2019s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and fish\u2014a detail that supports the text\u2019s main purpose by conveying Julius\u2019s usefulness.",

    "passage": "When ancient oak planks were unearthed during subway construction in Rome, Mauro Bernabei and his team examined the growth rings in the wood to determine where these planks came from. By comparing the growth rings on the planks to records of similar rings in oaks from Europe, the team could trace the wood to the Jura region of France, hundreds of kilometers from Rome. ==Because timber could only have been transported from distant Jura to Rome by boat, the team\u2019s findings suggest the complexity of Roman trade routes.==",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied growth rings to obtain information about the ancient oak planks found during a construction project in Rome. The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France\u2019s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the findings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a difficult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to present a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team\u2019s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks were used in the construction of a boat, nor does the underlined sentence question that conclusion. Instead, the text states that the wood could only have been transported from Jura to Rome in a boat. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply offers a conclusion drawn from the team\u2019s findings about the likely place of origin of the ancient planks; the text never mentions why oak was chosen for the planks instead of other wood. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole addresses any methods that Romans used in constructing subways.

The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is \u201caeolian transport.\u201d The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn\u2019t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered difficulties in their study.

The first sentence presents the general claim that industrial activity is not always a threat to wildlife. The underlined portion of the sentence that follows suggests that the silver-studded blue butterfly is an example of wildlife thriving in areas of industrial activity: active limestone quarries. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to introduce a specific example in support of the general claim in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect. Although the first sentence indicates that \u201cindustrial activity is often assumed\u201d to harm wildlife, in the case of the silver-studded blue butterfly the text mentions neither an assumption about this species nor any challenge to such an assumption. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only one study: the \u201csurvey.\u201d Additional studies are not mentioned in the text. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor any other portion of the text provides a definition for any of the terms used in the text\u2019s argument.",

    "passage": "The following text is from Lucy Maud Montgomery\u2019s 1908 novel *Anne of Green Gables*. Anne, an eleven-year-old girl, has come to live on a farm with a woman named Marilla in Nova Scotia, Canada. Anne reveled in the world of color about her. \u201cOh, Marilla,\u201d she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, \u201cI\u2019m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn\u2019t it? Look at these maple branches. Don\u2019t they give you a thrill\u2014several thrills? I\u2019m going to decorate my room with them.\u201d \u201cMessy things,\u201d said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed. \u201cYou clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.\u201d",
    "choices": [
      "A) To demonstrate that Anne has a newly developed appreciation of nature",
      "B) To describe an argument that Anne and Marilla often have",
      "C) To emphasize Marilla\u2019s disapproval of how Anne has decorated her room",
      "D) To show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by noting that Anne \u201creveled in the world of color about her\u201d\u2014that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped \u201caesthetic sense,\u201d or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as \u201cmessy things\u201d and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne\u2019s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn\u2019t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla\u2019s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne\u2019s personality.",

Atlante and Rinaldo are neighbors who have been secretly exchanging letters through Charlot, Atlante\u2019s sister. [Atlante] gave this letter to Charlot; who immediately ran into the balcony with it, where she still found Rinaldo in a melancholy posture, leaning his head on his hand: She showed him the letter, but was afraid to toss it to him, for fear it might fall to the ground; so he ran and fetched a long cane, which he cleft at one end, and held it while she put the letter into the cleft, and stayed not to hear what he said to it.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is\u00a0the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The narrator begins by explaining how Charlot carefully delivers Atlante\u2019s letter to Rinaldo, and then relates that Rinaldo feels \u201ctransported with joy\u201d after reading the letter. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character\u2019s happiness after reading the letter. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there\u2019s no explanation why another character hasn\u2019t written one. In addition, the text\u2019s description of Rinaldo \u201cin a melancholy posture\u201d suggests that he\u2019s sad and thoughtful, not that he\u2019s desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Charlot won\u2019t toss the letter to Rinaldo because she doesn\u2019t want it to fall, the text doesn\u2019t refer to the contents of the letter. Instead, the text describes how happy Rinaldo feels after reading it.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t make any reference to the sun or sunrise; instead, it focuses on presenting a single image of night as a person with certain clothing and features.

The text begins by stating that the new picture \u201cfailed to fit in\u201d with the other items that the shop owner has.

Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there\u2019s no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any other items.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to discuss how Derksen\u2019s compositions incorporate elements from both Indigenous and classical music. After introducing Derksen, the text describes how the songs Derksen composed for her album Orchestral Powwow feature aspects of the two musical traditions. Specifically, the text notes that Derksen wrote songs in the style of traditional powwow music but accompanied them with classical arrangements played by an orchestra that followed the beat of a powwow drum rather than the directions of a conductor. In this way, Derksen\u2019s compositions blend different cultures. Choice B is incorrect because although the text suggests that Derksen\u2019s songs contain innovative elements since they blend styles from two different musical traditions, it doesn\u2019t discuss whether her compositions constitute a new style of music, let alone whether Derksen should be recognized for creating a new style of music.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention any difficulties Derksen encountered when producing her album.

The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplified by the text\u2019s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted.

The first sentence of the text indicates that Johnson returned to the US in 1938 at which time his painting style suddenly changed. The second sentence is underlined and gives more detail about this stylistic change, noting that his earlier work consisted largely of landscapes in an expressionist style and his new works were highly stylized portraits of Black Americans. In other words, the function of the underlined sentence is to elaborate on a transitional moment in Johnson\u2019s painting career. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does mention that Johnson spent a decade in Europe, it does not discuss what other travel Johnson might have done. Furthermore, although the text mentions African, American, and Scandinavian artistic elements in Johnson\u2019s work, it does not indicate that he traveled to different locations to learn about these practices. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not focus on Johnson\u2019s personal life nor does it address how successful his career was in general. Choice D is incorrect because, rather than call it into question, the underlined sentence continues the discussion of Johnson\u2019s career by adding further relevant detail of Johnson\u2019s artistic transformation.",

He hired himself out for three months; at the end of that time to receive for his wages two hundred acres of land lying in New Hampshire. [...] His employer proving false to the contract in the matter of the land, and there being no law in the country to force him to fulfil it, Israel\u2014who, however brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch, seems nevertheless to have evinced, throughout many parts of his career, a singular patience and mildness\u2014was obliged to look round for other means of livelihood than clearing out a farm for himself in the wilderness.",

      "D) It explains why, when the situation requires it, Israel is able to undertake courageous acts that others would generally avoid."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months\u2019 work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer\u2019s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm. Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel\u2019s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel\u2019s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text\u2014that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues\u2019 hypothesis regarding this question\u2014which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer\u2014and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team\u2019s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team\u2019s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn\u2019t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team\u2019s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn\u2019t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn\u2019t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo\u2019s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo\u2019s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.",

The remainder of the text explains that the researchers hope their work in Atacama will support inquiry into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined portion functions mainly to indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert. Choice A is incorrect because to contrast two things means to show the differences between them, and the phrase \"closely mirrors\" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extreme environment in the Atacama Desert is similar to, not different from, that on Mars.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that there were many Spanish-language newspapers in cities across Texas in the late 1800s, citing San Antonio as a city that produced eleven such newspapers. The text then goes on to note that in El Paso, there were twenty-two newspapers published in Spanish in the late 1800s, more than any other Texas city. The text then concludes by explaining that the reason for this large number of Spanish-language newspapers was likely El Paso\u2019s location near Mexico and its large population of Spanish speakers. Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to explain that Spanish-language newspapers thrived in Texas cities, especially in El Paso, in the late 1800s. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas today, let alone compare them with newspapers that were published in the 1800s. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes El Paso as a particularly rich site for Spanish-language journalism in the late 1800s, the text doesn\u2019t discuss whether newspapers published in El Paso influenced the newspapers published in other cities across Texas, including San Antonio. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention whether Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas were also widely read in Mexico. The text only focuses on the popularity of Spanish-language newspapers within Texas, and especially in El Paso.",

The text begins by noting that researchers have long believed that woolly mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points. The text then describes an experiment conducted by an anthropologist to test this hypothesis. According to the text, the results of the experiment led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters using spears with Clovis points likely weren\u2019t the primary cause of the extinction. The anthropologist\u2019s results cast doubt on the long-held hypothesis presented at the beginning of the text and suggest that woolly mammoths may have become extinct in North America due to some other cause. Choice A is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that researchers have been involved in an ongoing debate. On the contrary, the text suggests that most researchers agree on the cause of the woolly mammoth\u2019s extinction in North America. Choice B is incorrect because the text never mentions any advantages or disadvantages of the method used in the experiment, focusing instead on the results achieved using that method. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only one hypothesis, that mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by introducing the natural phenomenon of intermittent mass loss with regard to Asteroid 6478 Gault and notes that it curiously has not lost mass at its perihelion like other asteroids typically do. The text then refutes \"solar energy\u2013driven ice vaporization\" and \"the singular nature of impact ejection\" as two possible explanations for Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss. Finally, the text presents Luu et al.\u2019s explanation that \"6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability,\" which the author says is \"likely correct.\" Thus, the overall structure of the text is that it introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then presents a third explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t distinguish between multiple observations. It focuses on the single observation that Asteroid 6478 Gault is losing mass and evaluates multiple explanations for the phenomenon. The text also asserts that Luu et al.\u2019s explanation is credible and \"likely correct.\" Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a natural phenomenon, not a specific astronomical finding. In addition, although the text does note flawed reasons for Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss, it doesn\u2019t mention that Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss is based on new evidence. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does evaluate explanations for the cause of Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss, the text also asserts that Luu et al.\u2019s explanation that they have put forth is persuasive and \"likely correct.\"",

The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant figures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement\u2019s participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement\u2019s participants.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega\u2019s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn\u2019t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe\u2014nor does any portion of the text.

Although the narrator mentions that she had to learn the home telephone number before her mother would give her permission to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about memorizing the telephone number. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to navigation tasks like finding a route to a store only through backyards, the text contains no specific directions to any store, nor is any store identified as the narrator\u2019s favorite. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion makes no mention of the narrator\u2019s mother and doesn\u2019t address the narrator\u2019s relationship with her. Although the narrator mentions that her mother gave her permission as a child to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about the mother or her relationship to her child.",

The text says that Dingle \u201cskillfully winds\u201d parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that \u201cno factory can reproduce.\u201d This context suggests that Dingle\u2019s baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm.

The text explains that certain economic historians \u201cassumed\u201d that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. Choice B is incorrect.

Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians \u201cregretted,\u201d or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, \u201cconcede\u201d means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe \u201cBronze Age societies were ruled by men.\u201d But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included \u201cvaluable objects signaling a high position of power,\u201d which would raise the possibility that \u201cwomen may have also held leadership roles.\u201d Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. Choice A is incorrect because \u201cwaive\u201d means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn\u2019t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, \u201crefute\u201d means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team\u2019s finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \u201crequire\u201d means to demand or specify as mandatory.

At first \u201cirregular and misty,\u201d or haphazard and indistinct, the figure\u2019s outline gradually showed \u201cdistincter grace and beauty\u201d until the general design of the carved object \u201cwas now obvious to the common eye,\u201d or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cassumed\u201d can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can\u2019t acknowledge its own precision.

Choice A is incorrect because saying that Ochoa \u201cdemands,\u201d or insists or requires, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth\u2019s would not make sense in context.

The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context conveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not sufficiently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help. Choice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as \u201cprepared for\u201d\u2014or ready for\u2014speaking Quechua wouldn\u2019t make sense in context.

The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn\u2019t have. As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras. Choice B is incorrect because \u201cdelicate\u201d means fine in texture or structure or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn\u2019t focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it\u2019s breakable. Choice C is incorrect because \u201cinevitable\u201d means impossible to avoid, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text doesn\u2019t discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because \u201chabitual\u201d means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s. Jenkins\u2019s ability to take advantage of video cameras to make art was therefore newfound, not habitual, at the time.",

As used in this context, \u201ccomplexity\u201d means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are difficult to follow or explain. The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is difficult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that\u2019s challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can\u2019t do justice to the novel\u2019s complexity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word \u201caccuracy,\u201d or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn\u2019t discuss whether Tokarczuk\u2019s novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a difficult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because \u201cinactivity\u201d means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context.

The text portrays a woman who is looking at \u201ctrees in their spring beauty.\u201d She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the \u201ceasy unhuman loveliness\u201d of trees: she thinks of cities as \u201cseductive\u201d and \u201ccharming,\u201d both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them.

Such attractive qualities are not described by the word \u201csignaling\u201d alone. Therefore, \u201csignaling\u201d is an incorrect answer because it is insufficiently precise.

The text also indicates that historians ultimately decided the letters were a hoax, or fraudulent. This context suggests that the historians couldn\u2019t confirm that the letters were authentic.

In this context, \u201cinadequate\u201d means not satisfactory. The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes \u201cthe loss of material quality.\u201d The text contrasts that with Chazovachii\u2019s chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text\u2019s emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields.

Although the text suggests that there have been changes in the field of recycling, as is the case with the advent of Chazovachii\u2019s chemical recycling process, there is nothing to suggest that the mechanical process itself has changed or is prone to change. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \u201csatisfactory\u201d would mean acceptable but not perfect.

The text indicates that although the flashes that fireflies produce appear to occur randomly\u2014that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm\u2014each species actually produces its own special series of flashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of flashes are so unique that fireflies can use them to find other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that fireflies produce flashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. Choice A is incorrect because \u201cquantities\u201d means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different firefly species produce flashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to find them, it doesn\u2019t mention the number of flashes that are used in these sequences.

Although it may be reasonable to say that firefly flashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that fireflies use these unique sequences of flashes to find other members of their own species, not that the flashes make fireflies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \u201cagreements\u201d would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about.

Instead, the text focuses on Pico\u2019s mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature\u2019s role in his tribe\u2019s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his \u201crenunciation of\u201d nature would mean that he portrays himself as rejecting nature, which isn\u2019t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and negative responses toward nature, not that he\u2019s giving it up completely.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his \u201cmastery over\u201d nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn\u2019t supported by the text. The text focuses on Pico\u2019s mixed feelings about nature; nothing in the text suggests that Pico feels mastery over nature.",

In other words, they use technology to inspect small parts of matter that can\u2019t be seen by the naked eye. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time \u201cselecting,\u201d or choosing, subatomic particles for some purpose; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter.

The text indicates that Ashbery\u2019s poems have many unusual features, that it\u2019s difficult to tell what exactly the poems\u2019 subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it\u2019s difficult to interpret Ashbery\u2019s poems. Choice A is incorrect because \u201cdelegate\u201d means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context. The text is focused only on the difficulty that readers have interpreting Ashbery\u2019s poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn\u2019t suggest anything about the poems being difficult to delegate.

    "choices": ["A) Denying", "B) Entering", "C) Carrying", "D) Hearing"],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201creceiving\u201d most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, \u201chis ears could not help receiving the words\u201d). The words are being perceived specifically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance\u2019s ears couldn\u2019t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don\u2019t enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn\u2019t make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word \u201ccarry\u201d can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one \u201ccarries the blame\u201d for a mistake).",

In this context, to \u201csimulate\u201d most nearly means to represent a natural process using computer models. According to the text, understanding Earth\u2019s early climate is difficult because we cannot make direct observations of the distant past. Instead, scientists must create computer models that approximate early climate conditions, based on the physical evidence that those conditions left behind on Earth\u2019s surface. This context supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth\u2019s climate in the distant past. Choice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence\u00a0as a basis for developing computer models that describe what Earth\u2019s actual past climate might have been like.

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Southern Pacific Railroad. As used in this context, \"dominance\" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California\u2019s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California\u2019s coast. Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word \"creativity\" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California\u2019s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad\u2019s control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California\u2019s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its \"insignificance,\" or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad\u2019s \"neutrality,\" or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would \"neutrality\" in the sense of impartiality in a conflict be a logical or precise choice since no conflict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conflict between the Southern Pacific Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conflict in which the Southern Pacific Railroad would take an impartial position.",

The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are \u201cconsiderable variations\u201d in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays\u2019 age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to find out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity.

In this context, \u201censuring\u201d means guaranteeing, or making sure of, the cucurbits\u2019 survival. The text states that cucurbits faced extinction in the past because their means of seed dispersal disappeared, but the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began farming cucurbits around that same time, so the crops were no longer threatened. Therefore, the context supports the idea that the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America helped with ensuring the cucurbits\u2019 survival.

The text also presents the critics\u2019 view as being influenced by a perception that fine artists create works that are \u201ctimeless\u201d and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase. This context suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion tend not to overlap\u2014in other words, that they rarely intersect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that critics contend that fine art and fashion rarely \u201cprevail,\u201d or prove to be triumphant or widespread. The text indicates that Okuma is an example of an artist who demonstrates that it\u2019s possible to make fine art that is also available to the public as fashion. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that fine art and fashion rarely \u201csuccumb,\u201d or surrender. The text establishes that unlike what critics believe, Okuma creates works that are in art museums and available for the public to purchase, suggesting that critics believe fine art and fashion rarely overlap, not that they rarely succumb. Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely \u201cdiverge,\u201d or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text presents Okuma\u2019s work as both fine art and fashion, thereby undermining what the critics assert. This suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely intersect rather than that the two rarely diverge.",

In other words, each organism provides the same kind of benefit it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen). Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a \u201csymbiotic exchange\u201d in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus \u201coverreacts,\u201d or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient.

In this context, \u201csaturated with\u201d means thoroughly or completely supplied with. The text explains a problem encountered by some bicycle-sharing programs: users can return bicycles to different locations than where the users picked up the bicycles to start, which can result in a mismatch between bicycle supply (that is, where the bicycles are currently located) and user demand (that is, the locations where users are hoping to pick up bicycles). The text goes on to explain that Ikeguchi developed a way to identify when this mismatch is likely to occur. This context suggests that Ikeguchi\u2019s method will show when it is likely that some locations have an insufficient supply and other locations, by implicit contrast, are saturated with bicycles. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some locations are \u201csusceptible to,\u201d or sensitive to or easily influenced by, bicycles. The text describes the phenomenon of bicycles being redistributed away from locations where users want them, not anything about those locations being influenced by the bicycles.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the text describes situations in which some locations have an insufficient supply of bicycles because the bicycles have been relocated elsewhere, which suggests that the other locations have many bicycles, not that the other locations are \u201ccontingent on,\u201d or dependent on, the bicycles.

The text describes situations in which bicycles have been relocated such that there is a mismatch between bicycle supply and user demand\u2014the bicycles are no longer at the locations where users want to pick them up.

      "B) partnership",
      "C) discovery",
      "D) disagreement"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the cover art of Virginia Woolf\u2019s novels. In this context, \u201cpartnership\u201d means collaboration or joint effort. The text states that Woolf\u2019s sister Vanessa Bell was a talented painter and that Bell worked with Woolf to provide the cover art for most of Woolf\u2019s novels. Thus, this context suggests that Woolf and Bell pursued a creative partnership in order to produce several of Woolf\u2019s novels. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Woolf or Bell were undergoing a \u201crebellion,\u201d or revolt, against anything in particular. Instead, the text focuses on how they worked together in some aspects of the production of Woolf\u2019s novels. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a \u201cdiscovery,\u201d or encountered anything new for the first time as they worked together. The text suggests that Woolf had already written her novels and that Bell then assisted Woolf with the cover art for many of them. Choice D is incorrect because the text implies that Woolf and Bell had a positive relationship. According to the text, the sisters \u201cworked closely\u201d together to produce the cover art for many of Woolf\u2019s novels; the text doesn\u2019t mention whether while working together, Woolf and Bell had a \u201cdisagreement,\u201d or conflict.",

    "passage": "The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde\u2019s 1895 play *The Importance of Being Earnest*. CECILY: Have we got to part? ALGERNON: I am afraid so. It\u2019s a very painful parting. CECILY: It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time. The absence of old friends one can ==endure== with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable.",
    "choices": ["A) Regret", "B) Persist", "C) Tolerate", "D) Encourage"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201cendure\u201d most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cendure\u201d can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can\u2019t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others\u2019 absences, not on her treatment of others.",

In this context, \u201ccollected\u201d means acquired and took away. The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid\u2019s surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu. Choice A is incorrect because in this context \u201cattached\u201d means connected or affixed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn\u2019t suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid.

The text doesn\u2019t suggest that the spacecraft tracked the sample, and it\u2019s not clear what it would mean for the spacecraft to travel behind the sample it collected.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because in this context \u201creplaced\u201d means put back or returned.

As used in this context, \u201csynchronization\u201d means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant flower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before flowering. Choice B is incorrect because referring to \u201chibernation,\u201d or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in\u2014making use of a protein and producing flowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in \u201cprediction,\u201d or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about flowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular flowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to flower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to \u201cmoderation,\u201d or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant\u2019s flowering activity; the two plants simply flower in unison.",

In this context, \u201cintroduced\u201d means brought into practice or use. The text states that the first reference to a seven-day week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. The text presents this information about the seven-day week as an example of a concept introduced by the Sumerian civilization that persists into present-day civilizations. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization \u201ctransformed,\u201d or changed the nature of, concepts that persist into present-day civilizations.

Choice C is incorrect because \u201cwarned\u201d means informed someone in advance about something dangerous, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Juarez. In this context, \u201cimportant\u201d means marked by significant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, became a certain kind of figure in Mexico\u2019s history. It then supports that claim by describing some of the \u201cmany significant accomplishments\u201d from Juarez\u2019s long tenure in office. This context conveys that Juarez is a significant and consequential figure in Mexico\u2019s history. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez\u2019s role as the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was \u201cunpredictable,\u201d or tended to behave in ways that couldn\u2019t be predicted. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was a particularly \u201csecretive\u201d figure, or that he tended to keep things private or hidden from others. Instead, the text focuses on things that are known about Juarez: that he was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, that he had a lengthy tenure, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national government\u2019s authority and advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office. Rather than suggesting that Juarez was an \u201cordinary,\u201d or common and typical, figure in Mexico\u2019s history, this context conveys that Juarez was instead a notable figure.",

As used in this context, \u201cpredicted\u201d means forecast, or indicated that something would happen in the future. The text indicates that the fashion resale market made a lot of money in 2019 and that some analysts expected the market to continue to grow. This context suggests that the analysts believed that the fashion resale market was going to make more money than it had already made, with the analysts indicating that revenues would more than double by 2028. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that some analysts \u201cproduced,\u201d or manufactured or brought about, the increase in future revenues of the fashion resale market. The analysts themselves couldn\u2019t have brought about the future revenue growth, since, as the text suggests, they were merely in the position of drawing conclusions about future fashion resale market revenue based on 2019 revenue. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they \u201cdenied,\u201d or rejected, this notion. Nothing in the text supports the idea that these analysts thought the revenues wouldn\u2019t grow. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they \u201cworried,\u201d or felt concerned, that revenue would significantly increase by 2028. Nothing in the text suggests that the analysts felt concerned about the increase; rather, the text suggests that the increase would represent a favorable outcome, since it would mean that the fashion resale market grew to generate even more revenue.",

The text indicates that Zepeda\u2019s many accomplishments in linguistics are varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetry in more than one language, creating a grammar book, and co-founding a language institute. This context supports the idea that Zepeda\u2019s contributions to the field are extensive. Choice A is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda\u2019s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence.

In this context, \u201cabrupt\u201d means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reflects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversification, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period. This context establishes that these remains\u2019 entry into the fossil record was sudden. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word \u201cexplosion\u201d appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d or disastrous. In context, \u201cexplosion\u201d refers to the rapid diversification, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record\u2014a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversification is \u201celusive,\u201d or difficult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as \u201cimminent,\u201d or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago.",

In this context, \u201ccollaboration\u201d means working together with someone to write a literary work.

The text indicates that interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics \u201chave challenged\u201d the economist\u2019s claim that sales of personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the economist\u2019s projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist\u2019s projection entirely\u2014the delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to \u201cdispute,\u201d or argue against, the economist\u2019s projection wouldn\u2019t make sense.

The text describes Mary\u2019s surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there\u2019s \"a little wind.\" To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word \"rough\" with a description of the wind blowing in \"delightful little gusts,\" suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"rough\" objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn\u2019t mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, \"delightful little gusts,\" which suggests that the use of \"rough\" here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn\u2019t \"basic,\" or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in \"delightful little gusts.\" Choice D is incorrect because the word \"vague\" means not clearly expressed or seen. Nothing in the text indicates that the wind was barely noticeable to Mary as she played outside, but rather the text states that it was delightful.",

    "passage": "The following text is adapted from Amy Lowell\u2019s 1912 poem \u201cSummer.\u201d It is summer, glorious, deep-toned summer, The very crown of nature\u2019s changing year When all her surging life is at its full.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, a span of time is described as \"a void\" space, which most nearly means an empty or vacant one. In the text, the speaker describes summertime in counterintuitive terms: although nature\u2019s \"surging life is at its full\" during the season, the speaker feels summer to be \"a time of pause, / A void and silent space between two worlds.\" The speaker says further that during summer, \"feeling sleeps / Gathering strength\" for future efforts. Thus, the speaker regards summer as an empty stretch of time, to be followed by a period of greater activity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does present summer as a time of inactivity, it doesn\u2019t characterize that inactivity as useless, or as having no purpose; in fact, the speaker regards summer as a time when \"feeling\" gathers \"strength for efforts yet to come.\" Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes summer as a time \"when inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps,\" it doesn\u2019t discuss the season\u2019s relationship to the speaker\u2019s memory or suggest that summer can easily be forgotten. Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, \"void\" can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness. However, the text doesn\u2019t portray summer as not being complete or whole; instead, it characterizes vacancy or inactivity as being an essential quality of the season, as experienced by the speaker.",

As used in this context, \u201covershadowed by\u201d means to be surpassed by or caused to seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to be more important than state taxes. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren\u2019t as important a consideration as other factors when people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn\u2019t suggest that state taxes are \u201cconsistent with,\u201d or in agreement with these other factors.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that state taxes are \u201crepresentative of,\u201d or typical of, other factors.

In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable to have an opinion about state taxes.

This context suggests that these discoveries provide evidence for the archaeologists\u2019 theory about the dating of the amphitheater.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201csimply\u201d most nearly means easily, or involving minimal difficulty or effort. The text first provides Alice\u2019s reflections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel\u2019s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be efficiently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice\u2019s plan is that it can be easily arranged. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice\u2019s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that it can be arranged \u201cfaintly,\u201d or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201csimply\u201d can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word \u201chastily\u201d indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice\u2019s plan was made in haste, the text doesn\u2019t focus on this aspect of her plan.

The text indicates that Gilliam is an artist who made draped canvases and, later, quilt-like paintings.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of baleen whale accessory spleens. In this context, \u201clatent\u201d means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales\u2019 diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is \u201creplicable,\u201d or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn\u2019t address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn\u2019t be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is \u201cpredetermined,\u201d or decided in advance, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn\u2019t been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales.

As used in this context, \u201cperipheral\u201d means situated toward the outer bounds rather than the center. The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required \u201ca long overland journey.\u201d This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire\u2019s territory rather than near its center. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco\u2019s location within the Aztec Empire as \u201cunobtrusive,\u201d or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it\u2019s not clear how a province\u2019s physical location would or wouldn\u2019t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco\u2019s location was, the text emphasizes the province\u2019s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required \u201ca long overland journey.\u201d Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was \u201cconcealed,\u201d or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn\u2019t see it, and being hidden wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring \u201ca long overland journey.\u201d Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco\u2019s location within the Aztec Empire was \u201capproximate\u201d would mean that the location either wasn\u2019t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco\u2019s location is known and that it was far from the empire\u2019s capital, so there\u2019s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location.",

The text indicates that \u201cpeople can take simple steps\u201d to avoid bringing possible invasive species into new environments.

As used in this context, \u201cconfined to\u201d means restricted to. The text says that Vel\u00e1zquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were influenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s influence was hardly (or almost not) confined to, or restricted to, Spain. Choice A is incorrect because if Vel\u00e1zquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn\u2019t make logical sense to claim that his influence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s techniques would by definition be influenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Vel\u00e1zquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his influence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that deliberately limiting Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s influence outside Spain was ever considered by anyone. Thus, even if it is true that his influence was not repressed, or restrained, it doesn\u2019t make logical sense to say so in this context.",

The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they \u201cdon\u2019t strictly observe every tradition.\u201d By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques. Choice A is incorrect because in this context \u201cexperiment with\u201d would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members \u201cdon\u2019t strictly observe every tradition.\u201d The phrase \u201cexperiment with\u201d wouldn\u2019t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions.

As used in this context, \"transformed\" means substantially changed in some way. The text states that the invention radically altered the semiconductor industry, with some historians claiming that it had a fundamental effect on the industry by allowing for mass production for the first time. This context conveys that the invention of the integrated circuit transformed the semiconductor industry. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the invention of the integrated circuit significantly affected (\"radically altered\") the semiconductor industry, it doesn\u2019t indicate that the invention \"overwhelmed\" the industry, which in this context would mean that it overcame the industry such that the industry struggled or was defeated. Instead, the text conveys that the invention\u2019s effect was positive, since it allowed the semiconductor industry to begin making use of mass production methods. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense in context to say that the invention of the integrated circuit \"bypassed\" the semiconductor industry, which would mean it intentionally avoided the industry. The text indicates that the invention directly affected the semiconductor industry, since it made it possible for the industry to begin engaging in mass production methods.

In this context, \"reduced\" means decreased. The text presents the finding from a team of neuroeconomists that decision making may be connected to communication between the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. In presenting this finding, the text suggests a contrast between people who tend to be more decisive and people who make decisions more slowly. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between the two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. On the other hand, this context suggests that people make choices more slowly when the flow of information between the two brain regions is decreased. Choice B is incorrect because \"evaluated\" means assessed, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people\u2019s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to assess the information.

    "choices": ["A) invented", "B) adjusted", "C) featured", "D) recommended"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Ester Hernandez\u2019s art. In this context, \"featured\" means shown prominently. The text focuses on where Hernandez\u2019s works have been and continue to be displayed, explaining that her early works, which consisted of murals, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San Francisco. The central contrast developed in the text is between where her early works could be viewed and where her works can be viewed now, which is in museums across the United States and around the world. The context therefore supports the idea that Hernandez\u2019s works are now shown, or featured, in museums globally. Choice A is incorrect because in this context \"invented\" would mean created something for the first time, which isn\u2019t supported since the text doesn\u2019t discuss where Hernandez creates her works or whether they\u2019re original or innovative. Choice B is incorrect because \"adjusted\" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez\u2019s early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez\u2019s works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez\u2019s works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works. Choice D is incorrect because \"recommended\" in this context would mean endorsed or put forth as a suggestion for something that is worth seeing. Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn\u2019t discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez\u2019s works.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the W boson. In this context, \"scale\" means size or extent. The text indicates that recent measurements of the W boson were remarkable because they revealed the subatomic particle\u2019s mass to be much greater (\"seven standard deviations higher\") than had been expected based on a standard model. This context conveys not only that the measurements differed from predictions but also that the extent of the difference was very large. Choice A is incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the measurements of the subatomic particle were notable because they differed from expectations and also because a difference existed between the measurements and what had been predicted; the text would be repeating the idea that there was a difference instead of adding to that idea.

Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"recognizable\" would mean identifiable, and since the text indicates that noses are often missing from ancient statues, they therefore cannot be the most recognizable part of the statue. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many ancient statues are missing noses, so noses wouldn\u2019t be \"common,\" or frequent, aspects of ancient statues; they would conversely be uncommon. Choice D is incorrect because the text only indicates that noses on ancient statues often stick out and end up missing from the heads, which doesn\u2019t relate to the noses being \"sophisticated,\" or knowledgeable or refined.",

The text describes a study in which cuttlefish demonstrated an ability to exercise restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of eating a meal that was already available to them. That is, by delaying gratification, the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated that they were capable of, or competent at, exercising self-control. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstrating self-control, cuttlefish are \"awkward,\" or lacking skill or grace.

As used in this context \"intangible\" means unable to be physically handled or touched. The text states that star formations cannot be touched, and then goes on to explain that Imara created a special model to research star formations. In other words, despite the fact that real star formations are intangible, thanks to Imara, researchers can handle models of star formations to better understand them. Choice A is incorrect because \"repeatable\" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form are untouchable, but that Nia Imara has produced interactive models of them. It would therefore be illogical to suggest that Imara believes that the formations need not be duplicated and then go on to say that she has copied them. Choice B is incorrect because \"explicable\" means explainable or understandable, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imara believes that star formations can be fully explained but rather that she produced interactive models to physically study them because researchers are unable to touch them directly.

The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as \"the multitude of Paris,\" meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi\u2019s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi\u2019s attempt to drive down the street. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn\u2019t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn\u2019t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi\u2019s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi\u2019s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time.

Generally, a roof\u2019s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive\u2014that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn\u2019t limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion.",

    "passage": "The following text is from the 1989 novel *The Ancient Child* by Kiowa writer N. Scott Momaday. The main character has achieved tremendous commercial success as a painter. More and more often he was asked to compromise his art or himself in one way or another, and more often than not he did so, for he was inclined to be passive and na\u00efve; it was difficult for him to say no. Those who exhibited his work, who praised and purchased it, and who demanded its proliferation began to determine it. \u00a91989 by N. Scott Momaday",
    "choices": ["A) Conclude", "B) Dictate", "C) Evaluate", "D) Select"],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text \"determine\" most nearly means \"dictate.\" The text describes the relationship between the main character and those who exhibit, praise, and purchase his artwork. The text states that the main character is often asked to change his art or himself based on outside influences, and he usually acquiesces. Because the main character admits that those who support his work often shape it based on their demands, it follows that those outside influences dictate, or guide or dominate, the direction his work takes. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that outside influences \"conclude,\" or end, the main character\u2019s work. The text states that many supporters of the main character\u2019s art \"demand its proliferation,\" not its conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that outside influences are \"evaluating,\" or judging the main character\u2019s work. According to the text, the main character\u2019s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character\u2019s work and are not questioning or evaluating its success or worth. They are instead influencing its initial direction. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that outside influences \"select,\" or choose the main character\u2019s work. According to the text, the main character\u2019s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character\u2019s work and are not selecting it. They are instead influencing its initial direction.",

    "choices": ["A) inspire", "B) ignore", "C) promote", "D) reduce"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the preservation efforts undertaken by Erika Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana. In this context, \"promote\" means play a part in the success or growth of something or someone. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes work to preserve culturally important sites. It goes on to say that their decision to create a national trail connecting the sites was motivated by the fact that such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn\u2019t otherwise receive. Thus, such a decision would promote the preservation efforts. Choice A is incorrect because \"inspire\" means motivate or influence, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text establishes that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that their decision to create a new national trail occurred as a result of a desire to add protections to the sites that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise receive. Thus, creating the trail wouldn\u2019t inspire the efforts to preserve the sites; instead, it would promote the efforts. Choice B is incorrect because \"ignore\" means overlook, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn\u2019t otherwise receive. Thus, the creation of the trail would promote, not ignore, the preservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect because \"reduce\" means decrease or restrict, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn\u2019t otherwise receive. The decision would therefore promote, not reduce, the preservation efforts.",

    "passage": "The way in which individual elements are balanced within a photographic image tends to affect how viewers perceive it: symmetry tends to give the elements equal importance, asymmetry emphasizes differences, and radial balance (organizing the elements around a central point) emphasizes the center over the periphery. What a photograph conveys is therefore largely ______blank how it is balanced.",

      "A) inhibited by",
      "B) contingent on",
      "C) obligated to",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of visual balance in photography. In this context, \"contingent on\" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inhibited by\" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"obligated to\" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph\u2019s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"reserved for\" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose. The text as a whole does not support the claim that a photograph\u2019s message is reserved for how that photograph is balanced.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd. As used in this context, \"inconsequential to\" means not significant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd\u2019s works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his influence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren\u2019t inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period. Choice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd\u2019s time had access to his works, not whether his works were \"controversial among,\" or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd\u2019s era were aware of his works, not that they were \"antagonistic toward,\" or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd\u2019s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"imitated by\" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd\u2019s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn\u2019t specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn\u2019t support the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd\u2019s works.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of imported goods and consumer prices. In this context, \"nullify\" most nearly means negate or undermine. The text indicates that importing goods to a country can reduce consumer prices in that country, then cautions that the costs of transporting goods within the country is also a factor. These transportation costs likely raise the prices that must be paid by people who live far from the ports of entry. Therefore, the intranational transportation costs could nullify the price advantages to consumers of importing goods. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"denigrate\" would most nearly mean disparage or deny the importance of. Since transportation costs would not be capable of denying the importance of price advantages, it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs denigrate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"underestimate\" would most nearly mean predict a lower value for, or to undervalue, someone or something. Though transportation costs might be undervalued, they cannot themselves undervalue something else, so it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs underestimate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"misconstrue\" would most nearly mean misunderstand.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Carmen Lomas Garza\u2019s artistic process. In this context, \"inspired by\" means influenced by or motivated by. The text refers to how, regardless of the scale of the work, Garza uses her memories of Texas and details from California to create her art. If Garza is basing her work on her direct experiences, then they play a part in her artistic process. This context thus suggests that Garza\u2019s art is inspired by the experiences of her childhood in Texas and her current life in California. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make logical sense to indicate that Garza is \"complimented by\"\u2014or praised by\u2014something inanimate such as direct experience. Choice B is incorrect because describing Garza as \"uncertain about\"\u2014or unsure or doubtful of\u2014direct experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza were unsure of her experiences, that would suggest that she couldn\u2019t recall them, and Garza wouldn\u2019t be able to represent direct experience in her art if she were uncertain of the memories or details. Choice C is incorrect because describing Garza as \"unbothered by\"\u2014or uninterested in\u2014her experience would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about Garza\u2019s artistic process.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \"invent\" most nearly means create or make up. The text begins by stating that Sara likes to tell stories and thoroughly enjoys telling them. The rest of the text describes how she looks and acts when she invents, or creates, \"wonderful things\" in her stories (\"what she told\"). Choice A is incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is disguising, or trying to cover up or conceal, \"wonderful things\" when she tells stories; rather, she is creating them and presenting them in ways that make them \"lovely or alarming\" for her listeners.

The text states that manul cats live in \"out-of-the-way parts of Asia\" (citing the famously remote Mount Everest as an example) and indicates that it is difficult to research the cats because of the location of their habitats. By emphasizing that the habitats are remote in relation to humans, the text conveys that being \"distant from,\" or far from, large groups of humans makes manul cats challenging to study. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the habitats of manul cats are \"full of large populations of humans\" would indicate that the cats cohabitate with many humans, which would directly contradict the text\u2019s claim that the cats live in \"out-of-the-way\" areas. Choice B is incorrect because the missing words describe an aspect of manul cats\u2019 habitats, or the areas where they live, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that areas could be \"drawn to,\" or attracted by, large groups of humans.

In this context, \"inexpensive\" means less costly or low in price. The passage describes two kinds of methods that can be used to \"detect objects or people through walls\": radar and sonar, and changes to the Wi-Fi technology used in smartphones. The word \"comparatively\" before the blank indicates that the best answer would be one that helps to describe a comparison between the two. Radar and sonar are described as \"costly,\" while the method that uses Wi-Fi technology is described as \"cheap\"; therefore, it would be comparatively affordable, or inexpensive.

As used in this context, \"responsive\" means reacting positively. The text presents a finding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean sounds may encourage oyster larvae to establish a reef (a permanent home): groups of oyster larvae that heard recorded sounds of a healthy oyster reef were two times more likely to show signs of forming their own reef than groups that heard different ocean recordings were. This context conveys that the groups that heard healthy reef sounds had a more positive reaction than the other groups did\u2014that is, they were the most responsive. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to become \"inactive,\" or to stop engaging in work or activity. Instead, the text conveys that the groups that heard those sounds were observed engaging in activity: they were two times more likely to create a reef (a permanent home) than groups that heard different ocean sounds were. Choice C is incorrect because describing the groups of oyster larvae that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef as most \"liked,\" or regarded with pleasure, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a study found that healthy reef sounds may encourage groups of oyster larvae to form reefs (permanent homes), not on the idea that some of the groups in the study were liked more than others. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to be \"distressed,\" or to experience difficulty or begin to decline.

Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is bland, or uninteresting; rather, she notices the sound and comments on how \"nice\" it is.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the dating of Machu Picchu. In this context, \"original\" means first or initial. The text indicates that Lucy Salazar and her colleagues have determined the age of Machu Picchu and that the age differs from another estimate of the site\u2019s age, explaining that the site is about 20 years older than scholars thought in 1911 when they initially encountered Machu Picchu. In other words, Salazar and her team found that the site\u2019s age differs from the first estimate. Choice A is incorrect. The text\u2019s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"genuine,\" or actual and true, while the one by Salazar\u2019s team wasn\u2019t, since the text treats the finding by Salazar\u2019s team as true and as invalidating the earlier estimate (\"it is approximately 20 years older than scholars thought\"). Choice B is incorrect. The text\u2019s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"intentional,\" or done on purpose, while the one by Salazar\u2019s team wasn\u2019t; the text indicates that Salazar and her colleagues were deliberately using radiocarbon dating to study Machu Picchu. Choice C is incorrect. The text\u2019s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. There\u2019s no reason to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"independent,\" or not controlled by or affiliated with others, while the one by Salazar\u2019s team wasn\u2019t; there\u2019s no mention of any outside influence on the work by Salazar and her team or by scholars in 1911.",

    "passage": "Eighteenth-century historian Edward Gibbon thought the only character defect of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius was his mild temperament\u2014though the emperor was widely considered virtuous, his overly permissive nature led him to ______blank the vices of those who surrounded him.",
    "choices": ["A) indulge", "B) despise", "C) moderate", "D) criticize"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. In this context, \"indulge\" means treat with excessive leniency. The text states that according to historian Edward Gibbon, Marcus Aurelius, who was widely considered virtuous, had only a single character flaw: his mild temperament. The text suggests that because of this flaw, Marcus Aurelius had an overly permissive nature. This context, in turn, supports the idea that Marcus Aurelius treated the vices, or evils, of those around him with excessive leniency, indulging rather than punishing those vices. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Marcus Aurelius was widely considered virtuous, it gives no indication that he was inclined to \"despise,\" or hate, others\u2019 vices. Rather, the text suggests that he showed undue tolerance for these vices because of his overly permissive nature\u2014that is, his inclination to allow others to do as they wished. Choice C is incorrect because the text\u2019s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others\u2019 vices, not that he tried to \"moderate\" those vices, or lessen their intensity. Choice D is incorrect because the text\u2019s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others\u2019 vices, not that he attempted to \"criticize,\" or speak disapprovingly of, those vices.",

    "choices": ["A) forgetting", "B) rejection", "C) imitation", "D) opinion"],

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of novelist Leon Forrest\u2019s admiration of William Faulkner\u2019s writing style. In this context, \"imitation\" means something that resembles or reproduces something else. The text states that Forrest admired Faulkner\u2019s style and that anyone familiar with Faulkner\u2019s style would be able to see the stylistic similarities between a particular passage in Forrest\u2019s novel Divine Days and Faulkner\u2019s writing, a fact that supports the idea that Forrest\u2019s novel pays tribute to Faulkner by reproducing, or imitating, Faulkner\u2019s style. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, a \"forgetting\" would mean an instance in which something is overlooked or not remembered. The text emphasizes Forrest\u2019s admiration for Faulkner\u2019s style and the fact that Forrest\u2019s writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner\u2019s stylistically. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner\u2019s style, Forrest failed to remember it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, a \"rejection\" would mean a dismissal of something as unworthy. The text emphasizes Forrest\u2019s admiration for Faulkner\u2019s writing style, stating that parts of Forrest\u2019s writings indicate efforts to copy that style. It wouldn\u2019t make sense therefore to suggest that Forrest had rejected or dismissed Faulkner\u2019s style as unworthy. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, an \"opinion\" would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on Forrest\u2019s admiration of Faulkner, which suggests that Forrest had formed a positive judgment of Faulkner\u2019s style, the word opinion wouldn\u2019t make sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn\u2019t say that the passage from Forrest\u2019s novel expresses his view of Faulkner\u2019s style; rather, it suggests that stylistically, the passage closely resembles, or imitates, Faulkner\u2019s writing.",

It then goes on to describe what the photograph showed, or displayed, which is a portrait of Nina\u2019s great-great-grandmother Rosita as a young woman. Thus, the text indicates that the photograph displayed a portrait of Rosita.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the art at the National Museum of the American Indian. In this context, \"homogenous\" means uniform or highly similar. The text explains that the painters whose works are included in this museum\u2019s collection employ an array of artistic styles, both Native and non-Native, traditional and new. Given this high degree of stylistic diversity, it is a misconception that Native art is uniform, or homogenous. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t consider whether Native art is controversial, or causes disagreement or discussion; instead, the text discusses the stylistic diversity of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some of the artists whose work is represented in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian blend various artistic traditions into highly individual styles of their own, this is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text is concerned with how Native art is often mistakenly perceived as uniform, when in fact it is stylistically diverse. Choice C is incorrect because the text never implies that people mistakenly conceive of Native art as theoretical, or concerned with philosophical or abstract issues; instead, the text\u2019s discussion of Native art is framed around this art\u2019s stylistic diversity versus the misconception of it as homogenous.",

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text \"reaching across to\" most nearly means stretching toward. The text begins with Mrs. Wilkins stating that she wants to have one of the oranges that she\u2019s admiring. The text then indicates that Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she is, holds out a big orange to her friend. This context suggests that when the text describes Mrs. Wilkins as reaching across to the bowl of oranges, it means that she is stretching toward the bowl. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is joining with, or becoming attached to, the bowl of oranges. Rather, the text indicates that she is stretching toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is gaining on, or overtaking in a competition or race, the bowl of oranges. The text suggests instead that the bowl is sitting still on a surface and that Mrs. Wilkins is extending her arm toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Mrs. Wilkins is arriving at the bowl of oranges.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing \"similarities with\" means having some resemblance to. The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren\u2019t closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are \"examples of,\" or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren\u2019t closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can\u2019t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"concerns about\" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indications of\" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn\u2019t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups.",

    "choices": ["A) defunct", "B) arcane", "C) ubiquitous", "D) extraneous"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of artworks that were produced for exhibition on the internet. In this context, \"defunct\" means no longer existing or functioning. According to the text, many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible due to their reliance on certain software. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim\u2019s Genesis, which relied on software that was discontinued in 2021. This context supports the idea that the software is defunct. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that viewing artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet requires the use of software. Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is \"arcane,\" or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it\u2019s now defunct. Choice C is incorrect because \"ubiquitous\" would mean found everywhere, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them. According to the text, one example of such software is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it\u2019s now defunct. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the software used to view artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is \"extraneous,\" or irrelevant.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the Kelmscott Press\u2019s books. In this context, \"manifest in\" means evident or apparent from. The text states that the Kelmscott Press, which was cofounded by William Morris, produced its books using preindustrial methods. The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization is \"insensible to,\" or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization. Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense to say that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization was \"scrutinized by,\" or examined closely by, the Kelmscott editions\u2019 use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation. Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris\u2019s work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris\u2019s attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris\u2019s repudiation of industrialization is \"complicated by,\" or made more complex or difficult by, the Kelmscott Press\u2019s use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books.

This context conveys that there is little agreement when it comes to these categories.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the early British postal system. In this context, \"reforms\" most nearly means attempts at improving something. The text indicates that the pay-upon-delivery postage method led to fee avoidance on the part of recipients. It then says that action was taken to improve the postal system, giving examples such as the move to having the sender pay and affixing stamps to indicate payment had been received. These represent revisions to the system intended to improve its functioning; therefore, \"reforms\" most logically completes the text. Choice A is incorrect.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of wild rice. As used in this context, \"sensitive\" means vulnerable or easily affected. The text indicates that climate change is causing the lakes to get deeper, which consequently threatens the wild rice that grows in the area. The text goes on to state that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to uproot from the bottom of the lake. This context supports the idea that the plants are sensitive to water depth during early stages of development. Choice A is incorrect because \"immune\" means protected or shielded, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text explains that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to become uprooted and destroyed, indicating that these plants are harmed by deep water, not protected from it. Choice C is incorrect because \"limited\" means confined or restrained, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text explains that water depth can negatively affect young wild-rice plants but doesn\u2019t suggest that water depth limits or restrains the plants.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the origins of the unique dialect of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico. In this context, \"traced\" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Ta\u00ednos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba. Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"surrendered,\" or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been \"announced,\" or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"offered,\" or presented as a gift, to the pronunciation in Yoruba.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of environmental management along the US and Mexican border. In this context, \"requires\" means needs in order to perform a task. The text indicates that because ecosystems span the border, actions taken by the government on one side of the border can affect the environment in the nation on the other side of the border, which makes international cooperation crucial. In other words, because actions on one side of the US and Mexican border can affect the other side of the border, managing environmental matters along the border requires coordination between the two governments. Choice B is incorrect because \"praises\" in this context would mean to express a favorable judgment, but the text doesn\u2019t describe approval expressed by anyone, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that environmental management itself praises intergovernmental coordination. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"reports\" would mean gives an account. Although coordination between the US and Mexican governments likely would involve some sort of reporting, the text doesn\u2019t describe any such practice. Choice D is incorrect.

At supper time, Fox-Foot would allow no fire to be built, no landing to be made, no ==trace== of their passing to be left.

In other words, Fox-Foot doesn\u2019t want there to be any trace, or evidence, of the group\u2019s movements (\"their passing\") through the area. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Fox-Foot doesn\u2019t want the group to be detected, not that he doesn\u2019t want their presence to create a blemish, or a spoiling flaw, in the area; human activity could disturb a natural environment, but the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is instead focused on avoiding giving any sign of the group\u2019s movements through a place (\"their passing\") to anyone who might be following them. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on Fox-Foot\u2019s desire to avoid detection by those who might be following the group. This context conveys that Fox-Foot doesn\u2019t want to create any signs or evidence of the group moving through a place (\"their passing\"), not that he doesn\u2019t want to leave behind some quantity of their presence; indeed, it isn\u2019t clear what an amount of a group\u2019s movement would be. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the group has a sketch, or rough drawing, of their movements through that area (\"their passing\") that might be left behind.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of solar energy collection and storage. In this context, \"fluctuations in\" means irregular changes in. The text notes that economists recommend that countries that want to rely more on solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) should attempt to expand their storage capacity. The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of \"unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze\"\u2014that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that having ample solar energy stored and ready to use can mitigate the issue of fluctuations in solar energy collection caused by irregular patterns of sunlight availability. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"developments of solar energy collection\" would most clearly refer to the creation of ways to collect solar energy (energy captured from sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (\"cloud cover and haze\"); there\u2019s no reason to think that the creation of new collection methods would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated.

The text goes on to state that some cities are establishing incentives to promote small business shopping. This context supports the idea that some cities are instituting programs to encourage this consumer behavior. Choice B is incorrect because saying that some cities are \"occupying,\" or forcibly holding possession or control of, programs that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses wouldn\u2019t make sense in context.

The text draws a contrast between the lack of \"deliberately signaled\" political themes in women-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about women-authored science fiction from the 1970s. This contrast implies that the work from the 1970s did clearly reflect feminist political themes. In other words, the text indicates that unlike women who wrote science fiction in the 1920s to the 1960s, the women who wrote science fiction in the 1970s expressed overtly feminist themes. Choice A is incorrect. In this context \"prudently\" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science fiction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"cordially\" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a significant factor for women writing science fiction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s.

In this context, \"accidental\" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos\u2019s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos\u2019s findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos\u2019s findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics\u2019 opinion regarding the kea\u2019s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea\u2019s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics\u2019 opinion in this context must be that the kea\u2019s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental. Choice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos\u2019s claim that the kea\u2019s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea\u2019s usage of stones \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea\u2019s stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea\u2019s usage of small stones was \"obvious,\" or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea\u2019s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea\u2019s usage of small stones was \"observable,\" or visible, this would not conflict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea\u2019s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.",

The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can \"exceed,\" or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.

The text indicates that the magnetic fields of some metals change under stress and that Saleem and colleagues showed that it is possible to measure those changes from a distance, thereby demonstrating that the integrity of underground metal pipes can be evaluated without having to unearth them. This context thus indicates that Saleem and colleagues made productive use of, or exploited, this tendency of the metals\u2019 magnetic fields.

      "A) antecedent",
      "B) impending",
      "C) innocuous",
      "D) perpetual"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of advance indications of solar flares. In this context the word \"impending\" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun\u2019s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful\u2014solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth\u2014and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic\u2014increased brightness in a particular region of the corona\u2014comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending. Choice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun\u2019s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were \"antecedent,\" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word \"innocuous,\" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist. But the word \"perpetual,\" or never-ending, would in context indicate that the flare exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun\u2019s corona, which would not make logical sense.",

    "passage": "Latro, the main character of Gene Wolfe\u2019s novel *Soldier of the Mist*, is a man in ancient Greece. He completely loses his memory whenever he sleeps. So, before sleeping, Latro records the important experiences of each day on a scroll, carefully choosing which ones to ______blank.",
    "choices": ["A) suspect", "B) preserve", "C) suggest", "D) imagine"],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latro, the main character in Gene Wolfe\u2019s novel Soldier of the Mist. In this context, \"preserve\" means save or keep from destruction or loss. The text describes Latro as a character who loses his memory whenever he sleeps. The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss. Choice A is incorrect because \"suspect\" would mean mistrust, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"suggest\" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"imagine\" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it\u2019s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he\u2019s fabricating the experiences he records.",

      "C) Remembered",
      "D) Celebrated"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, \"mingled\" most nearly means combined. In the text, the speaker refers to several concepts mingling together and then compares this to \"the blending of\" two other things (an exotic plant and the fragrance of a strange flower). This comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts of love, April, and the gold of someone\u2019s hair as being blended together, or combined. Choice A is incorrect because \"mingled\" means combined, not identified. The speaker names several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone\u2019s hair) and then moves to a comparison of their mingling together to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower, conveying the idea that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined. Choice C is incorrect. The text as a whole may refer to a memory, but the comparison of the mingling of several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone\u2019s hair) to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower conveys that the speaker views those concepts as actually blended together, or combined, and not simply remembered at the same time. Choice D is incorrect. The speaker refers to several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone\u2019s hair) and then compares the mingling together of those concepts to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower; rather than suggesting that the concepts are celebrated, this comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined.",

    "choices": ["A) distinct", "B) required", "C) unintended", "D) unknown"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Ronyoung Kim\u2019s novel Clay Walls. In this context, \"distinct\" means clearly separate and different. The text indicates that the novel consists of three sections and that each section is narrated from the perspective of a different character. This context supports the idea that Kim\u2019s novel features three distinct perspectives. Choice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim\u2019s novel as \"required,\" or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. When writing a novel, a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There\u2019s nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim. Instead, the text focuses on identifying the three different perspectives featured in Kim\u2019s novel. Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim\u2019s novel as \"unintended,\" or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel. Choice D is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim\u2019s novel as \"unknown,\" or not revealed, wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. The text directly identifies the three perspectives that appear in her novel as those of Faye and her two parents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the novel\u2019s perspectives are in fact known.",
