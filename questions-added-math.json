This is the number of members that will have joined the film club $4$ days after the first day of the semester if $100$ new members, not $10$ , join the film club each day. Choice C is incorrect. This is the number of members the film club will have $4$ days after the first day of the semester if $1$ new member, not $10$ , joins the film club each day. Choice D is incorrect.

    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. It’s given that the perimeter of an isosceles triangle is $36$ feet and that each of the two congruent sides has a length of $10$ feet. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. The equation $10 + 10 + x = 36$ can be used to represent this situation, where $x$ is the length, in feet, of the third side. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields $20 + x = 36$ . Subtracting $20$ from each side of this equation yields $x = 16$ . Therefore, the length, in feet, of the third side is $16$ . Choice A is incorrect. This would be the length, in feet, of the third side if the perimeter was $30$ feet, not $36$ feet.

    "passage": "",
    "choices": ["$0$", "$3$", "$8$", "$12$"],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is correct. If an equation has infinitely many solutions, then the two sides of the equation must be equivalent. Multiplying each side of the given equation by $2$ yields $8 x + 24 = a ( x + 3 )$ . Since $8$ is a common factor of both terms on the left-hand side of this equation, the equation can be rewritten as $8 ( x + 3 ) = a ( x + 3 )$ . The two sides of this equation are equivalent when $a = 8$ . Therefore, if the given equation has infinitely many solutions, the value of $a$ is $8$ . Alternate approach: If the given equation, $4 x + 12 = \\frac{ a ( x + 3 ) Over 2 }$ , has infinitely many solutions, then both sides of this equation are equal for any value of $x$ . If $x = 0$ , then substituting $0$ for $x$ in the given equation yields $4 ( 0 ) + 12 = \\frac{ a ( 0 + 3 ) Over 2 }$ , or $12 = three halves a$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $three halves$ yields $8 = a$ . Choice A is incorrect. If the value of $a$ is $0$ , the given equation is equivalent to $4 x + 12 = 0$ , which has one solution, not infinitely many solutions. Choice B is incorrect. If the value of $a$ is $3$ , the given equation is equivalent to $4 x + 12 = \\frac{ 3 ( x + 3 ) Over 2 }$ , or $4 x + 12 = three halves x + nine halves$ , which has one solution, not infinitely many solutions. Choice D is incorrect.

Let $x$ represent the number of days in which the estimated supply of paper cups will reach $1,700$ . The equation $4,500 - 70 x = 1,700$ represents this situation. Subtracting $4,500$ from both sides of this equation yields $- 70 x = - 2,800$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $- 70$ yields $x = 40$ .
