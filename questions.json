    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text\u2019s discussion of the percentages of maize exported in the marketing year 2012/2013. The graph presents percentages of maize exported by Argentina, Brazil, and the United States in marketing years 2009/2010 to 2013/2014 and indicates that for the marketing year 2012/2013, the percentage of maize exported by Argentina decreased to about 70 percent from about 80 percent in the previous marketing year. The graph also shows that the percentage of maize exported by Argentina remained highest among the three countries in the marketing year 2012/2013, surpassing the percentage exported by Brazil (about 31 percent) and by the United States (about 8 percent).Choice A is incorrect because for the marketing year 2012/2013, the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil didn\u2019t increase from the previous year; rather, it decreased from about 34 percent to about 31 percent. Moreover, the graph shows that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil remained higher, not lower, than the percentage exported by the United States in the marketing year 2012/2013. Choice B is incorrect because the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil never exceeded the percentage exported by Argentina for any of the marketing years represented. Choice D is incorrect because the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by the United States reached its lowest point, not its highest, during the five marketing years in 2012/2013, with the United States exporting only about 8 percent of its maize in that marketing year.",

The graph presents values for economic policy uncertainty in tax and public spending policy, trade policy, and general economic policy in the UK from 2005 to 2010. The graph shows that in 2005, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 90) was substantially lower than the value for uncertainty about trade policy specifically (approximately 160). It also shows that in 2010, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 120) was substantially higher than the value for uncertainty about trade policy (approximately 70). The substantial differences between these values in 2005 and 2010 support the claim that a general measure may not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of policy. Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that the level of general economic policy uncertainty was similar to the level of uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in both 2005 (with values of approximately 90 and 100, respectively) and 2009 (with values of approximately 80 and 75, respectively).\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that general economic policy uncertainty was higher than uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in 2006, 2007, and 2009, not that it was lower each year from 2005 to 2010.

According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by first having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The finding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers\u2019 claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the researchers\u2019 claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. The text doesn\u2019t address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn\u2019t serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn\u2019t help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers\u2019 claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true\u2014that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn\u2019t have any bearing on the researchers\u2019 claim about people behaving altruistically. Being aware of a challenge or problem isn\u2019t necessarily beneficial on its own and isn\u2019t the same as offering help, so the finding wouldn\u2019t support the idea that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior.",

To explain this, the researchers pointed to the general proximity of A. thaliana leaves to the ground and noted that rain splashing off soil could bring soil-based bacteria into contact with the leaves.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken the scientists\u2019 hypothesis about icebergs that appear to be green. The text indicates that most icebergs are either mostly white or blue in color but that some icebergs in Antarctica appear to be green. The text goes on to say that the scientists hypothesized that this green color occurs when yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in ocean waters mixes with blue ice. A finding that both blue icebergs and green icebergs contain similarly small traces of dissolved organic carbon would suggest that something other than yellow-tinted organic carbon causes some icebergs\u2019 green color, since the blue icebergs that contain yellow-tinted organic carbon remained blue instead of turning green. Choice A is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists\u2019 hypothesis was that blue icebergs, not white ones, change color when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon. A finding that white ice,\u00a0because of its air bubbles, doesn\u2019t change color when it\u2019s mixed with dissolved organic carbon would therefore have no bearing on the scientists\u2019 hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on Antarctic icebergs that appear to be green. It doesn\u2019t indicate that icebergs in locations other than Antarctica have been found to have a green hue. A finding that dissolved organic carbon has a stronger yellow color in Antarctic waters than in other places would therefore have no bearing on the scientists\u2019 hypothesis that green color in icebergs in Antarctica is caused by yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon mixing with blue ice. Choice C is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists\u2019 hypothesis was that blue icebergs turn green when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in the sea around them. If that\u2019s correct, one would expect blue icebergs and green icebergs to be located at a distance from each other since all blue icebergs in an area where the waters contain yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon would take on a green hue. A finding that blue icebergs and green icebergs are rarely found near each other would therefore strengthen, not weaken, the researchers\u2019 hypothesis.",

    "passage": "Icebergs generally appear to be mostly white or blue, depending on how the ice reflects sunlight. Ice with air bubbles trapped in it looks white because much of the light reflects off the bubbles. Ice without air bubbles usually looks blue because the light travels deep into the ice and only a little of it is reflected. However, some icebergs in the sea around Antarctica appear to be green. One team of scientists hypothesized that this phenomenon is the result of yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in Antarctic waters mixing with blue ice to produce the color green.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example. According to the graph, fewer than 10,000 sewing machines were sold in the Philippines in both 1903 and 1908, but nearly 30,000 were sold in 1913 and around 45,000 were sold in 1918. This increase illustrates the statement in the text that demand for Singer sewing machines grew significantly in the early twentieth century in overseas countries other than Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Choice B is incorrect because consistent sales of Singer sewing machines in New Zealand from 1903 to 1918 do not indicate that demand for the product increased but rather that demand remained relatively the same. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the data in the graph. Although sales in Australia did increase somewhat between 1903 and 1908, there was very little change between 1908 and 1913, and then sales declined between 1913 and 1918. The data for Australia, then, do not show a steady increase from 1903 to 1918. Choice D is incorrect because declining sales of Singer sewing machines in Turkey from 1913 to 1918 do not point to an increase in demand for the product but rather to a decline in demand.",

According to the text, thousands of ceramic bowls were found in a recovered Chinese shipwreck. The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls\u2019 chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had produced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls\u2019 origin. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the researchers used technology in the form of a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, it doesn\u2019t specifically state that this technology is new. In addition, the text says that Niziolek and her team used the tool to determine the chemical composition of bowls that were found in a Chinese shipwreck, not to locate and recover the shipwreck itself. There\u2019s no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers collected materials from old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the ceramic bowls, which means that the researchers must have already known the location of those kiln sites. Rather than identifying the location of the kilns, the researchers determined which kilns in operation 1,000 years ago had likely produced the bowls that were found in the shipwreck.\n\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although the text says that using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool enabled Niziolek and her team to analyze artifacts in the form of ceramic bowls without damaging them, the text doesn\u2019t discuss how researchers analyzed artifacts before this tool was invented. Moreover, the point that the bowls were left undamaged isn\u2019t the text\u2019s main idea.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of Ancestral Puebloans\u2019 migration to the Rio Grande Valley. The text states that in the late 1200s C.E., the Ancestral Puebloan civilization abandoned villages in its original homeland, which included the Mesa Verde site. The text goes on to say that recent genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande Valley descends partly from the ancient turkeys raised at Mesa Verde, and that the genetic markers shared by the two turkey populations first appeared at Mesa Verde only after 1280 C.E. Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried their agricultural practices\u2014including the farming of turkeys\u2014to their new home. Choice A is incorrect because the text never compares the condition of the Rio Grande Valley\u2019s terrain to that of Mesa Verde\u2019s terrain, either in the present or in the past. Choice C is incorrect. Although genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande valley descended in part from the turkey population raised by the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde before their migration to the valley in 1280, this finding doesn\u2019t eliminate the possibility that Indigenous peoples living in the valley before 1280 might also have farmed turkeys. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn\u2019t consider the possibility that before their migration to the Rio Grande Valley after 1280, the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde might have adopted turkey farming from an outside Indigenous civilization in another region; instead, the text provides evidence suggesting that the Ancestral Puebloans brought turkey farming to another region\u2014the Rio Grande Valley\u2014after 1280.",

Recent analysis comparing turkey remains at Mesa Verde, one such village in southern Colorado, to samples from modern turkey populations in the Rio Grande Valley of north central New Mexico determined that the latter birds descended in part from turkeys cultivated at Mesa Verde, with shared genetic markers appearing only after 1280.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur\u2019s 2021 analysis of the Vinland Map. The text indicates that while some scholars have believed that the map was drawn in the mid-1400s, the 2021 analysis showed the presence of the compound titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the map. The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn\u2019t used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn\u2019t have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn\u2019t have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn\u2019t have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers. Choice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn\u2019t available until the early 1900s doesn\u2019t imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn\u2019t have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding suggests that the map couldn\u2019t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn\u2019t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge\u2014and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers\u2014of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn\u2019t used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn\u2019t have been created in the mid-1400s. Choice D is incorrect because although the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for the creation of the ink that was used to draw the Vinland Map, the text does say that titanium dioxide was introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than the early 1900s. This finding, in turn, led the team to conclude that the Vinland Map couldn\u2019t have been drawn in the mid-1400s.",

If it were found that fermenting the beans significantly reduces their levels of soluble fiber, raffinose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body\u2019s ability to extract nutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would likely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and \u00c1lvarez claim).

The text states that Bhatt et al. found that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did. Because having a lower creep rate means that the material is slower to deform with exposure to stress, as the text explains, this finding suggests that aerospace composites made with the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may be able to withstand mechanical stress for a longer period than those made with the other two polymer-derived SiC fibers can.Choice A is incorrect because it overstates the implications of the study\u2019s findings, which have to do with the rate of a material\u2019s deformation under stress, not the absolute degree of deformation.

The text begins with Miranda responding to Prospero\u2019s claim that she probably doesn\u2019t remember her life before the island. She describes a distant memory, asking if she had \"four or five women\" caring for her. Prospero confirms this (\"thou hadst\") and then asks what else she can recall, stating that because she remembers one thing from the time before she lived on the island (\"ought ere thou camest here\"), she might also remember arriving on the island (\"how thou camest here\"). That is, Prospero indicates that Miranda\u2019s ability to summon details of an experience from before her arrival on the island suggests that she may also be able to summon details of her arrival.Choice A is incorrect because Prospero doesn\u2019t say anything about how Miranda presents her early childhood memory of having several people care for her\u2014he indicates only his surprise that she remembers something from so long ago (\"the dark backward and abysm of time\") and his thought that she may also be able to recall another childhood event: her arrival on the island. Further, Prospero doesn\u2019t suggest that he believes Miranda is discontent in her current circumstances. Choice B is incorrect. Although Miranda suggests some doubt about her recollection of a place other than the island, in that she describes it as \"like a dream\" she can\u2019t be certain of, Prospero doesn\u2019t mention her uncertainty\u2014though he himself wonders how it is possible that she correctly recalls something from so long ago (\"abysm of time\"). Rather than indicating that doubt is making Miranda reluctant, Prospero simply states that Miranda may have the ability to remember traveling to the island. Choice D is incorrect. Although Miranda describes a vague impression of several people who cared for her as a young child and states that it is \"rather like a dream\" instead of something she is certain is real, Prospero doesn\u2019t indicate that Miranda is remembering a childhood daydream. Instead, he confirms that what Miranda remembers actually happened, answering her question about having had caregivers with \"thou hadst,\" and asks her what else she can remember from long ago.",

    "passage": "The following text is from William Shakespeare\u2019s play The Tempest, first performed in 1611. Miranda has lived on an island with her father, Prospero, since she was three years old. Prospero has stated that Miranda likely does not remember anything other than her life on the island.",

    "bluebook": true,
    "choices": [
      "A) Miranda\u2019s reminiscences about her early childhood have a melancholy quality that betrays her discontented view of her current circumstances.",
      "B) Miranda\u2019s doubts about the accuracy of one recollection of a place other than the island are clouding her judgment and seem to be making her reluctant to explore her recollection of traveling to the island.",
      "C) Miranda\u2019s ability to summon details of an experience she had before arriving on the island suggests that she may also be able to summon details of her arrival on the island.",
      "D) Miranda\u2019s impression of a scene is vague because she is remembering a scenario she had daydreamed about as a child rather than a scenario that had occurred in reality."

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that turbines with larger rotor diameters produce more energy, so if rotor diameters have generally gotten larger between 2011 and 2021, then turbines created in 2021 should produce more energy than those created in 2011.Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The percentage of newly installed turbines with rotor diameters greater than 130 meters didn\u2019t show any visible increase until 2018. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn\u2019t justify the claim. The claim is about increasing energy output from 2011 to 2021, but this choice only discusses 2011, so it can\u2019t show evidence of change over time. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. In 2021, only about 25% of turbines installed in 2021 had rotor diameters greater than 130 meters.",

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents findings that, if true, would support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of \u2018Oumuamua is due to the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen. The text first introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named \u2018Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within \u2018Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: \u2018Oumuamua experienced sufficient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues\u2019 claim.Choice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from \u2018Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of \u2018Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner\u2019s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to \u2018Oumuamua, but the text states that \u2018Oumuamua is the first observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available.",

    "passage": "Initially observed in 2017, the interstellar object \u2018Oumuamua is the first object of its kind to be seen in our solar system. Researchers have been puzzled because its acceleration cannot be entirely explained by the gravitational pull of nearby bodies: there must be a nongravitational influence on its velocity and trajectory. Some previously suggested explanations for this nongravitational acceleration involve mechanisms that are unlikely or unrealistic, such as geometric effects from \u2018Oumuamua being potentially composed of several spatially separated bodies. Now, Jennifer Bergner and colleagues propose that the nongravitational acceleration is due to the gaseous expulsion of entrapped hydrogen from \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s water-rich icy body.",

      "A) Existing proposed models of outgassing from \u2018Oumuamua include the direct conversion of nitrogen or carbon monoxide from a solid to a gaseous state without becoming liquid, but these models have theoretical or observational inconsistencies.",
      "B) \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration that would be caused by the release of hydrogen gas resulting from the processing of water ice (H2O), but the interstellar object\u2019s observable properties can be explained if it has a significant component of molecular hydrogen ice (H2).",

The text indicates that A. thaliana plants show accelerated flowering at high temperatures. To investigate the mechanism for this accelerated flowering, biologists replaced the ELF3 protein in one group of A. thaliana plants with a similar protein found in another plant species that doesn\u2019t show accelerated flowering. The team then compared these modified plants to A. thaliana plants that retained their original ELF3 protein. The text states that the two samples of plants showed no difference in flowering at 22\u00b0 Celsius, but at 27\u00b0 Celsius the unaltered plants with ELF3 showed accelerated flowering while the plants without ELF3 didn\u2019t. If accelerated flowering at the higher temperature occurred in the A. thaliana plants with ELF3 but not in the plants without the protein, then ELF3 likely enables A. thaliana to respond to increased temperatures. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t mention whether any plants other than A. thaliana and stiff brome show temperature-sensitive flowering, so there is no support for the idea that this type of flowering is unique to A. thaliana. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the effects of ELF3 and not the production of it. There\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that the amount of ELF3 in A. thaliana\u00a0varies with temperature. Choice D is incorrect. While the text states that there was no difference in the flowering of modified and unmodified A. thaliana plants at 22\u00b0 Celsius, there\u2019s no suggestion that A. thaliana only begins to flower at 22\u00b0 Celsius; the text doesn\u2019t mention a specific temperature threshold required for A. thaliana flowering.",
