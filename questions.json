    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. This choice uses a semicolon in a conventional way to join the first main clause (\"The measurement...moved\") and the second main clause (\"for example...second\"). Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a coordinating conjunction, a comma can\u2019t be used in this way to join the two main clauses (\"The measurement\u2026moved\" and \"for example\u2026second\"). Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can\u2019t be used in this way to join the two main clauses (\"The measurement\u2026moved\" and \"one unit\u2026second\"). Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses (\"The measurement\u2026moved\" and \"one unit\u2026second\") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.",
