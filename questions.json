    "passage": "Artist Marilyn Dingle’s intricate, coiled baskets are _____ sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Following a Gullah technique that originated in West Africa, Dingle skillfully winds a thin palm frond around a bunch of sweetgrass with the help of a “sewing bone” to create the basket’s signature look that no factory can reproduce.",
    "choices": [
      "A) indicated by",
      "B) handmade from",
      "C) represented by",
      "D) collected with"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Marilyn Dingle’s baskets. In this context, to say that Dingle’s baskets are “handmade from” particular plants means that Dingle creates baskets herself using those plants but without using machines. The text says that Dingle “skillfully winds” parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that “no factory can reproduce.” This context suggests that Dingle’s baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text describes how Dingle uses sweetgrass and palmetto palm to create her baskets, not how her baskets are “indicated by,” or signified by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice C is incorrect. Although Dingle’s baskets are described as being made using sweetgrass and palm, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the baskets are “represented by,” or exemplified or portrayed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the focus of the text is on Dingle’s use of sweetgrass and palmetto palm and the impossibility of replicating the appearance of her baskets using machines. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Dingle’s baskets are “collected with,” or brought together in a group with, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the text describes how Dingle uses those plants to make her baskets."

    "question": "As used in the text, what does the phrase 'a singular' most nearly mean?",
    "passage": "The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1837 story “Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment.” The main character, a physician, is experimenting with rehydrating a dried flower.\n\nAt first [the rose] lay lightly on the surface of the fluid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon, however, a singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber.",
    "choices": [
      "A) A lonely",
      "B) A disagreeable",
      "C) An acceptable",
      "D) An extraordinary"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, 'singular' most nearly means extraordinary. The text portrays an experiment in which a character rehydrates a dried rose by infusing it with moisture. After prolonged contact with the liquid, the rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously 'crushed and dried' petals shift, and the entire flower revives 'from a deathlike slumber.' In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the flower.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts 'singular' can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of something, this usage doesn’t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text doesn’t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although 'singular' has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn’t portray the change undergone by the rose as necessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because 'singular' means extraordinary, not acceptable. The change is portrayed as striking, not barely satisfactory."

    "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "passage": "Rejecting the premise that the literary magazine *Ebony and Topaz* (1927) should present a unified vision of Black American identity, editor Charles S. Johnson fostered his contributors’ diverse perspectives by promoting their authorial autonomy. Johnson’s self-effacement diverged from the editorial stances of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke, whose decisions for their publications were more _____.",
    "choices": [
      "A) proficient",
      "B) dogmatic",
      "C) ambiguous",
      "D) unpretentious"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. A person who is 'dogmatic' believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one 'unified vision' of Black American identity that they prioritize over the 'diverse perspectives' of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. 'Proficient' means 'skilled.' Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. 'Ambiguous' means 'unclear' or 'open to multiple interpretations.' However, it’s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations ('diverse perspectives'). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to 'diverge' from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and firm (a 'unified vision'). Choice D is incorrect. 'Unpretentious' means 'not trying to impress others with greater skill or importance than is actually possessed.' Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others)."

    "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "passage": "Some economic historians _____ that late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households in the United States experienced an economy of scale when it came to food purchases—they assumed that large households spent less on food per person than did small households. Economist Trevon Logan showed, however, that a close look at the available data disproves this supposition.",
    "choices": ["A) surmised", "B) contrived", "C) questioned", "D) regretted"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. In this context, 'surmised' means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians 'assumed' that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. In this context, 'contrived' would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn’t supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it’s Logan and not the economic historians who 'questioned,' or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians 'regretted,' or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians’ emotional response to what households did in the past."

    "passage": "The following text is from Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel *Dracula*. The narrator is being driven in a carriage through a remote region at night.\n\nThe baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least *disturbed*; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.",

      "A) Disorganized",
      "B) Alarmed",
      "C) Offended",
      "D) Interrupted"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, 'disturbed' most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are 'dreadfully afraid,' but the driver is 'not in the least disturbed.' In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby."

    "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "passage": "Economist Marco Castillo and colleagues showed that nuisance costs—the time and effort people must spend to make donations—reduce charitable giving. Charities can mitigate this effect by compensating donors for nuisance costs, but those costs, though variable, are largely _____ donation size, so charities that compensate donors will likely favor attracting a few large donors over many small donors.",

      "A) supplemental to",
      "B) predictive of",
      "C) independent of",
      "D) subsumed in"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer. We’re told that charities that pay donors back for nuisance costs will attract a few large donors instead of many small donors. This suggests that nuisance costs are not linked to donation size.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are supplemental to (meaning in addition to) donation size, that wouldn’t result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs can predict donation size, that wouldn’t necessarily result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are subsumed in (meaning included in) donation size, that wouldn’t result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors."

    "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "passage": "During a 2014 archaeological dig in Spain, Vicente Lull and his team uncovered the skeleton of a woman from El Algar, an Early Bronze Age society, buried with valuable objects signaling a high position of power. This finding may persuade researchers who have argued that Bronze Age societies were ruled by men to _____ that women may have also held leadership roles.",
    "choices": ["A) waive", "B) concede", "C) refute", "D) require"],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, 'concede' means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe 'Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.' But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included 'valuable objects signaling a high position of power,' which would raise the possibility that 'women may have also held leadership roles.' Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because 'waive' means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn’t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, 'refute' means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team’s finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, 'require' means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age 'women may have also held leadership roles.'"

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. 'Involved in' means 'playing an active role in.' This fits the context clues describing how Zollar includes the audience in her shows by incorporating their stories and pictures.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. 'Nervous about' means 'worried or anxious about.' Nothing in the text suggests that people would be nervous about Zollar’s creative process. Choice B is incorrect. 'Completed by' means 'made whole by.' It doesn’t make sense to say that Zollar’s shows would make her audience complete. Choice C is incorrect. 'Delayed by' means 'made late by.' Nothing in the text suggests that people would be delayed by Zollar’s creative process."

Drowne, a young man, is carving a wooden figure to decorate the front of a ship.\n\nDay by day, the work assumed greater precision, and settled its irregular and misty outline into distinct grace and beauty. The general design was now obvious to the common eye.",

      "C) Imitated",
      "D) Speculated"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, 'assumed' most nearly means acquired, or came to possess. The text portrays a character named Drowne carving a figure out of wood. At first 'irregular and misty,' or haphazard and indistinct, the figure’s outline gradually showed 'distincter grace and beauty' until the general design of the carved object 'was now obvious to the common eye,' or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts 'assumed' can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can’t acknowledge its own precision. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wooden figure merely imitated, or mimicked, precision. Rather, the text suggests that as Drowne carved his wooden figure, it gradually became more precise. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts 'assumed' can mean speculated, or supposed based on incomplete information, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can’t speculate about its own precision."
