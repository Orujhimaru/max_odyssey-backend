    "question": "Based on the texts, Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?",
    "passage": "Text 1 Microbes are tiny organisms in the soil, water, and air all around us. They thrive even in very harsh conditions. That\u2019s why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn\u2019t seem to contain any life. The finding doesn\u2019t prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes\u2019 survival. Text 2 Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it\u2019s unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer\u2019s team\u2019s study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures.",
      "B) A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site.",
      "C) Microbes are likely difficult to detect in the soil at the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere.",
      "D) Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer\u2019s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer\u2019s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn\u2019t appear to contain any life. Fierer\u2019s team says that though this doesn\u2019t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it\u2019s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer\u2019s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer\u2019s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer\u2019s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn\u2019t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn\u2019t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer\u2019s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them, but the author doesn\u2019t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer\u2019s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples.",

Studying wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres, the team reported that traces of elements such as lithium and sodium support the presence of exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth\u2019s. Text 2 Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have concluded that certain exoplanets had continental crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signifiers of the types of rock found on Earth. The studies don\u2019t adequately account for different minerals made up of various ratios of those elements, and the possibility of rock types not found on Earth that contain those minerals.",

Therefore, Putirka and Xu would likely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium are also found in rocks that are not like Earth\u2019s continental crust. Choice A is incorrect because the texts do not indicate how widely held any of the viewpoints described are.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because neither text discusses how new this area of study is.

    "passage": "Text 1 In a study of the benefits of having free time, Marissa Sharif found that the reported sense of life satisfaction tended to plateau when participants had two hours of free time per day and actually began to fall when they had five hours of free time per day. After further research, Sharif concluded that this dip in life satisfaction mainly occurred when individuals spent all their free time unproductively, such as by watching TV or playing games. Text 2 Psychologist James Maddux cautions against suggesting an ideal amount of free time. The human desire for both free time and productivity is universal, but Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction. Furthermore, he points out that there is no objective definition for what constitutes productivity; reading a book might be considered a productive activity by some, but idleness by others.",

      "D) By claiming that the specific activities named in Text 1 are actually examples of productive activities rather than unproductive ones"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it characterizes how Maddux would most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif reached after her research. Text 1 describes Sharif\u2019s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. \u00a0However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively\u2014that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others.",

    "passage": "Text 1 The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event is usually attributed solely to an asteroid impact near Chicxulub, Mexico. Some scientists argue that volcanic activity was the true cause, as the K-Pg event occurred relatively early in a long period of eruption of the Deccan Traps range that initially produced huge amounts of climate-altering gases. These dissenters note that other mass extinctions have coincided with large volcanic eruptions, while only the K-Pg event lines up with an asteroid strike. Text 2 In a 2020 study, Pincelli Hull and her colleagues analyzed ocean core samples and modeled climate changes around the K-Pg event. The team concluded that Deccan Traps gases did affect global conditions prior to the event, but that the climate returned to normal well before the extinctions began\u2014extinctions that instead closely align with the Chicxulub impact.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes how Hull\u2019s team would most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1, which asserts that volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps range led to changes in the climate and caused the K-Pg mass extinction event. According to Text 2, although Hull\u2019s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the climate before the K-Pg event, the team determined that the climate had returned to normal before mass extinctions began. This finding and the observation that the K-Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub asteroid impact suggest that Hull\u2019s team would likely dispute the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 and say that the climate changes caused by the Deccan Traps activity were not the main cause of the extinctions. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull\u2019s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull\u2019s team would disagree that the Deccan Traps activity caused the K-Pg event. Additionally, the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 says nothing about how the Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull\u2019s team might believe that the impact did in fact change the climate, they could not be said to agree with the claim in Text 1 on this point.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication in either text that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity, so there is no reason to conclude that Hull\u2019s team would question why the scientists referred to in Text 1 make such an assumption.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull\u2019s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull\u2019s team would say that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring effect on global conditions than the scientists referenced in Text 1 believe, not that the effect on global conditions was more significant than those scientists claim.",

Researchers are investigating this feat partly to learn more about humans\u2019 comparatively limited abilities to regenerate, and they\u2019re making exciting progress. An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration. Text 2 When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Text 1 based on the information provided.

The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR\u2019s function in humans isn\u2019t yet known, it\u2019s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1\u2019s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava\u2019s team\u2019s observations about EGR in humans. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven\u2019t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn\u2019t say that Text 1\u2019s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1\u2019s excitement as premature and overly optimistic.

    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people.

However, Text 2 goes on to say \u201c[m]ore recently\u201d Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but \u201cthat European breeds lack,\u201d which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira\u2019s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey\u2019s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues\u2019 evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey\u2019s evidence is. Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from \u201c1321\u20131407 CE\u2014over a century before Europeans invaded the region\u201d and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey\u2019s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it reflects what the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say about what the researchers in Text 1 initially thought. Text 1 focuses on the discovery of a strange fossil consisting of the skull of the extinct species Oculudentavis khaungraae. According to Text 1, the fossil has features that appear to be avian, or related to birds, which led researchers to initially think that the fossil might be a very small avian dinosaur. Text 2 begins by noting the discovery of a second fossil similar to the one discussed in Text 1, then explains that based on detailed studies of both fossils, paleontologists think that the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls appeared avian at first. This suggests that the paleontologists in Text 2 recognize that the fossils do indeed look like they could be related to birds. For this reason, the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1\u2014that the fossil was avian\u2014is understandable, even if the fossil is probably not avian but rather is from a lizard. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the fossils initially looked avian, so the paleontologists described in Text 2 wouldn\u2019t be confused by the researchers in Text 1 initially thinking that O. khaungraae might be related to birds. The paleontologists would find that initial thought understandable, not confusing. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 never mentions lizards, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense for the paleontologists in Text 2 to say that the researchers in Text 1 mistakenly assumed that O. khaungraae must be a lizard. Choice D is incorrect. Although the paleontologists in Text 2 might agree that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1 was reasonable, nothing in Text 2 suggests that the two skulls were shaped differently.",

According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other.

Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues\u2019 perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.

In arguing that graphic novels shouldn\u2019t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"\u2014that is, comparatively very little\u2014in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn\u2019t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel\u2019s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes. Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn\u2019t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there\u2019s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn\u2019t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn\u2019t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn\u2019t imply that graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written\u2014that is, well crafted\u2014as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn\u2019t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren\u2019t well crafted.",

Knowing that cost reductions would expand access to mycoprotein, biochemists are exploring solutions, such as a cheaper substrate to feed the mycoprotein as it grows. Text 2 Cattle farming is a principal cause of global deforestation, and a study by Florian Humpen\u00f6der and his colleagues found that replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of mycoprotein would cut deforestation by half if accomplished over the next thirty years.

The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people\u2019s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people\u2019s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue.

The algae that brine shrimp feed on, however, can produce these pigments. Thus, the pinker the flamingo, the more shrimp it has eaten.

The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo\u2019s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn\u2019t the only thing that influences flamingos\u2019 coloring. Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn\u2019t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo\u2019s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos\u2019 feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn\u2019t notice a change wouldn\u2019t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo\u2019s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos\u2019 shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn\u2019t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.",

The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old\u2014much older than the Clovis people\u2019s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces\u2014that they are human-made tools\u2014that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence. Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn\u2019t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group\u2019s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn\u2019t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group\u2019s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent\u2019s first inhabitants. Therefore, there\u2019s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.",

    "passage": "Text 1 In 1954 George Balanchine choreographed a production of The Nutcracker, a ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage The Nutcracker each year.\u00a0But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced. Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences. Text 2 The Nutcracker is outdated, but it should be kept because it\u2019s a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show Hot Chocolate Nutcracker combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009.",

      "B) By agreeing that contemporary audiences have largely stopped going to see performances of The Nutcracker because it\u2019s so old-fashioned",
      "C) By pointing out that most dance companies could increase their incomes by offering modernized versions of The Nutcracker",
      "D) By suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by noting the success of The Nutcracker but then claims that the ballet is \"stuck in the past\" and should \"no longer be produced.\" Text 2 begins by conceding that The Nutcracker is indeed outdated but argues that it should continue to be performed, states that the show can be updated to include more contemporary dance styles, and provides an example of one such modernized version, Hot Chocolate Nutcracker. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 advocates for using creative ways to update The Nutcracker and therefore wouldn\u2019t respond to the underlined claim by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version. Choice B is incorrect because although the authors of both texts claim that The Nutcracker is outdated, neither text suggests that contemporary audiences have largely stopped attending productions of the show. On the contrary, Text 2 states that The Nutcracker is a holiday favorite and generates substantial income for some dance companies. Choice C is incorrect because although Text 2 provides an example of a contemporized version of The Nutcracker, the text doesn\u2019t suggest that offering modernized versions is a way to increase income for most dance companies. Rather, the author of Text 2 suggests that offering modernized versions is a way to make the ballet discussed in Text 1 feel less outdated.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain different ways in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius\u2019s helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood\u2019s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text\u2019s many examples of Julius\u2019s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t portray either the narrator\u2019s or his wife\u2019s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn\u2019t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together. In fact, it\u2019s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and fish\u2014a detail that supports the text\u2019s main purpose by conveying Julius\u2019s usefulness.",

    "passage": "When ancient oak planks were unearthed during subway construction in Rome, Mauro Bernabei and his team examined the growth rings in the wood to determine where these planks came from. By comparing the growth rings on the planks to records of similar rings in oaks from Europe, the team could trace the wood to the Jura region of France, hundreds of kilometers from Rome. ==Because timber could only have been transported from distant Jura to Rome by boat, the team\u2019s findings suggest the complexity of Roman trade routes.==",
    "choices": [
      "A) It presents a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team\u2019s findings.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied growth rings to obtain information about the ancient oak planks found during a construction project in Rome. The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France\u2019s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the findings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a difficult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to present a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team\u2019s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks were used in the construction of a boat, nor does the underlined sentence question that conclusion. Instead, the text states that the wood could only have been transported from Jura to Rome in a boat. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply offers a conclusion drawn from the team\u2019s findings about the likely place of origin of the ancient planks; the text never mentions why oak was chosen for the planks instead of other wood. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole addresses any methods that Romans used in constructing subways.

We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity.

At the beginning of the text, Tom asserts that he and the other people staging the play are doing so only for \u201ca little amusement among ourselves\u201d and aren\u2019t interested in attracting an audience or any attention with the production. Then, Tom promises that the play they chose is modest and appropriate, and he further reasons that using the well-written prose of \u201csome respectable author\u201d is better than using their own words. Overall, the main purpose of the text is to convey Tom\u2019s promise that the play will be inoffensive and involve only a few people.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The first two sentences introduce the idea that soil and rocks can be moved from one location to another by something other than rivers and streams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is \u201caeolian transport.\u201d The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn\u2019t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered difficulties in their study.

In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted to see if aeolian transport could explain the appearance of certain geological materials in Antarctica, and their findings did indeed confirm the involvement of aeolian transport. Choice D is incorrect. Although the first sentence of the text mentions soil and rocks, which are two different kinds of geological material, the underlined portion doesn\u2019t refer to these materials, nor does it explain the difference between them.

The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks \u201cstately and calm,\u201d the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was \u201cwide open to the long-expected guest,\u201d which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne\u2019s anticipation and Martha\u2019s activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage.

Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn\u2019t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla\u2019s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne\u2019s personality.",

Atlante and Rinaldo are neighbors who have been secretly exchanging letters through Charlot, Atlante\u2019s sister. [Atlante] gave this letter to Charlot; who immediately ran into the balcony with it, where she still found Rinaldo in a melancholy posture, leaning his head on his hand: She showed him the letter, but was afraid to toss it to him, for fear it might fall to the ground; so he ran and fetched a long cane, which he cleft at one end, and held it while she put the letter into the cleft, and stayed not to hear what he said to it. But never was man so transported with joy, as he was at the reading of this letter; it gives him new wounds; for to the generous, nothing obliges love so much as love.",

The narrator begins by explaining how Charlot carefully delivers Atlante\u2019s letter to Rinaldo, and then relates that Rinaldo feels \u201ctransported with joy\u201d after reading the letter. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character\u2019s happiness after reading the letter. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there\u2019s no explanation why another character hasn\u2019t written one. In addition, the text\u2019s description of Rinaldo \u201cin a melancholy posture\u201d suggests that he\u2019s sad and thoughtful, not that he\u2019s desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Charlot won\u2019t toss the letter to Rinaldo because she doesn\u2019t want it to fall, the text doesn\u2019t refer to the contents of the letter. Instead, the text describes how happy Rinaldo feels after reading it.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does describe Rinaldo\u2019s reaction to the letter, the text doesn\u2019t begin by discussing Atlante\u2019s inspiration for writing the letter.

After introducing Derksen, the text describes how the songs Derksen composed for her album Orchestral Powwow feature aspects of the two musical traditions. Specifically, the text notes that Derksen wrote songs in the style of traditional powwow music but accompanied them with classical arrangements played by an orchestra that followed the beat of a powwow drum rather than the directions of a conductor.

The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplified by the text\u2019s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey \"can persist across centuries and continents.\" Choice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn\u2019t indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any hypothesis. According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area. Choice C is incorrect because the third sentence doesn\u2019t discuss any particular species, let alone the species mentioned elsewhere in the text, nor does the sentence explain why species spread to new locations.

Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer\u2019s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of.

Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel\u2019s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel\u2019s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text\u2014that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.",

    "passage": "Very little is known about the role nocturnal insects, such as moths, play in flower pollination because it is difficult to monitor insects at night. To address this problem, a team of scientists used time-lapse cameras to record pollinator visits to red clover all day and night.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues\u2019 hypothesis regarding this question\u2014which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer\u2014and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team\u2019s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team\u2019s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn\u2019t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team\u2019s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn\u2019t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn\u2019t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo\u2019s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo\u2019s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.",

The first sentence of the text states that the CEP had a positive impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.

Although the sentence that contains the underlined portion mentions some CEP workshop topics, the underlined portion itself addresses the number of participants in the CEP workshops, not the number of topics covered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to attendees of the CEP workshops, nothing in the underlined portion or the text as a whole addresses the Southern Christian Leadership Conference\u2019s philosophy or the attendees\u2019 opinions thereof.

The first sentence describes a unique location on Earth, the Atacama Desert. The next sentence, which is the underlined sentence, states that the reason why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this unique location is that Atacama is a harsh environment that closely resembles the extreme environment of Mars. The remainder of the text explains that the researchers hope their work in Atacama will support inquiry into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined portion functions mainly to indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert. Choice A is incorrect because to contrast two things means to show the differences between them, and the phrase \"closely mirrors\" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extreme environment in the Atacama Desert is similar to, not different from, that on Mars. This similarity is why, according to the underlined sentence, astrobiologists conduct research in Atacama. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn\u2019t address forms of life that are unable to survive the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert. Instead, the underlined sentence explains why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this environment. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn\u2019t suggest that the scientific research in the Atacama Desert is limited in any way; instead, the sentence explains that the similarity between the environments of Atacama and Mars is the reason why astrobiologists search for life, or its remains, in Atacama.",

Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions a shepherd, it neither indicates that the shepherd is singing nor does it compare the shepherd to the speaker. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that the speaker works hard, engaging in \"hours of toil,\" and it can be inferred that the speaker likely lives in a rural area, since cows and a cowbell can be heard nearby. However, the text does not suggest that the speaker is a farmer or feels excited about farming. Moreover, the shepherd in the text is not a literal reference to someone who herds sheep but instead a figurative description of the moon as the shepherd of the stars.

The text begins by noting that researchers have long believed that woolly mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points. The text then describes an experiment conducted by an anthropologist to test this hypothesis. According to the text, the results of the experiment led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters using spears with Clovis points likely weren\u2019t the primary cause of the extinction. The anthropologist\u2019s results cast doubt on the long-held hypothesis presented at the beginning of the text and suggest that woolly mammoths may have become extinct in North America due to some other cause. Choice A is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that researchers have been involved in an ongoing debate. On the contrary, the text suggests that most researchers agree on the cause of the woolly mammoth\u2019s extinction in North America. Choice B is incorrect because the text never mentions any advantages or disadvantages of the method used in the experiment, focusing instead on the results achieved using that method. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only one hypothesis, that mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points. Rather than present a competing hypothesis, the text explains how one anthropologist designed an experiment to test this long-held hypothesis.",

    "passage": "Asteroid 6478 Gault has experienced intermittent mass loss since at least 2013, but in contrast to some other asteroids with repeated mass-loss episodes, 6478 Gault has not lost mass at its perihelion (the closest point of its orbit to the Sun), and thus the loss is not attributable to solar energy\u2013driven ice vaporization. And as Jane X. Luu et al. point out, the singular nature of impact ejection makes it untenable as an account of multiple loss episodes of similar duration over several years. Instead, Luu et al. are likely correct that 6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability.",
    "choices": [
      "A) It presents a scientific observation, describes a contrast between that observation and other observations, and then explains why those other observations should not be considered credible.",
      "B) It describes an astronomical finding, discusses competing theories about that finding that the author regards as flawed, and then describes new evidence that supports an alternative theory.",
      "C) It introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then presents a third explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible.",
      "D) It discusses a physical process, evaluates possible causes of that process, and then states that a persuasive account of the process has yet to be put forward."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by introducing the natural phenomenon of intermittent mass loss with regard to Asteroid 6478 Gault and notes that it curiously has not lost mass at its perihelion like other asteroids typically do. The text then refutes \"solar energy\u2013driven ice vaporization\" and \"the singular nature of impact ejection\" as two possible explanations for Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss. Finally, the text presents Luu et al.\u2019s explanation that \"6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability,\" which the author says is \"likely correct.\" Thus, the overall structure of the text is that it introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then presents a third explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t distinguish between multiple observations. It focuses on the single observation that Asteroid 6478 Gault is losing mass and evaluates multiple explanations for the phenomenon. The text also asserts that Luu et al.\u2019s explanation is credible and \"likely correct.\" Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a natural phenomenon, not a specific astronomical finding. In addition, although the text does note flawed reasons for Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss, it doesn\u2019t mention that Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss is based on new evidence. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does evaluate explanations for the cause of Asteroid 6478 Gault\u2019s intermittent mass loss, the text also asserts that Luu et al.\u2019s explanation that they have put forth is persuasive and \"likely correct.\"",

The text begins by mentioning scholarly accounts of the Chicano movement, which the underlined portion describes as tending \"to focus on the most militant, outspoken figures in the movement,\" making the movement as a whole seem uniformly radical. The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant figures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement\u2019s participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement\u2019s participants. Choice A is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does present a trend in scholarship on the Chicano movement, the text does not indicate that other scholars have reevaluated their methods in light of Herrera\u2019s work. It only indicates that Herrera\u2019s work suggests that the work of those other scholars does not provide a complete picture of the Chicano movement. Choice B is incorrect.

Choice D is incorrect.

    "passage": "The people of medieval Europe have traditionally been seen as uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene, but modern research has shown that this is largely a myth. According to historian Eleanor Janega, most medieval towns in Europe had at least one public bathhouse, which often offered both full-immersion baths and\u2014more affordably\u2014steam baths. While such amenities were available mainly to town dwellers, regular bathing in rivers and streams or daily sponge baths at home were common practices throughout medieval Europe.",

      "D) It explains why Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega\u2019s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn\u2019t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn\u2019t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe\u2014nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn\u2019t go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.",

The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, finishing one book per day over a long period of time. The text then suggests that even though she progresses slowly (\"she was still in the B\u2019s\") and that she struggled with some books (\"some of the B\u2019s had been hard going\"), she doesn\u2019t give up because she thinks of herself as \"a reader.\" These details show Francie\u2019s resolve.
