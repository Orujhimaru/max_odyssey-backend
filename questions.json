    "passage": "Believing that living in an impractical space can heighten awareness and even improve health, conceptual artists Madeline Gins and Shusaku Arakawa designed an apartment building in Japan to be more fanciful than functional. A kitchen counter is chest-high on one side and knee-high on the other; a ceiling has a door to nowhere. The effect is disorienting but invigorating: after four years there, filmmaker Nobu Yamaoka reported significant health benefits.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Although inhabiting a home surrounded by fanciful features such as those designed by Gins and Arakawa can be rejuvenating, it is unsustainable.",
      "B) Designing disorienting spaces like those in the Gins and Arakawa building is the most effective way to create a physically stimulating environment.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, conceptual artists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional elements, such as uneven kitchen counters and \u201ca door to nowhere.\u201d The text goes on to suggest that there may be benefits to this kind of design because filmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health benefits. Thus, although the design is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building\u2019s residents. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Yamaoka lived in the apartment for four years, it doesn\u2019t address how long someone can beneficially live in a home surrounded by fanciful features or whether doing so can be sustained.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions the potential benefits of living in a home with disorienting design features, it doesn\u2019t suggest that this is the most effective method to create a physically stimulating environment.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text refers to Yamaoka to support the claim that Gins and Arakawa\u2019s apartment building design may be beneficial, but the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Yamaoka supports the designs of other conceptual artists.",

Pando is one of the largest single organisms by mass on Earth, but ecologists are worried that its growth is declining in part because of grazing by animals. The ecologists say that strong fences could prevent deer from eating young trees and help Pando start thriving again.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation that is directly stated in the text for why ecologists are worried about Pando. The text states that Pando is a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that represents one of the largest organisms on Earth. According to the text, ecologists are worried that Pando\u2019s growth is declining, partly because animals are feeding on the trees. In other words, the ecologists are worried that Pando isn\u2019t growing at the same rate it used to. Choice B is incorrect. Rather than indicating that Pando isn\u2019t producing young trees anymore, the text reveals that Pando is indeed producing young trees, stating that those trees can be protected from grazing deer by strong fences. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that fences can be used to prevent deer from eating Pando\u2019s young trees, not that Pando itself can\u2019t grow in new areas because it\u2019s blocked by fences.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text offers no evidence that Pando\u2019s root system is incapable of supporting new trees or is otherwise a cause of worry for ecologists.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama\u2019s books. In the text, Heidi screams upon first seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that\u2019s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi\u2019s eyes as \u201cglowing\u201d and states that she \u201cdevoured the scene,\u201d suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book. Choice A is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as \u201clooking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures\u201d in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she\u2019s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon first seeing the image, the text\u2019s description of the image and Heidi\u2019s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text describes the images in the book as \u201csplendid\u201d and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather than frightening.

The text goes on to say that the existence of the Wigner crystal remained unconfirmed until Feng Wang and colleagues were able to make an impression of one using two semiconductors and an ultrathin sheet of graphene. Thus, the main idea is that researchers have obtained the most definitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal.

    "passage": "In superfluorescence, electrical charges known as dipoles emit light in synchronized bursts so intense that they are visible to the eye. Until recently, this phenomenon has only been observed at extremely cold temperatures because dipoles cannot synchronize at higher temperatures. But in a study, Melike Biliroglu and colleagues observed superfluorescence at room temperature in thin films made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials; the researchers propose that the formation of shock-absorbing quasiparticles called polarons in the material protects dipoles from thermal interference.",

      "A) Polarons enable superfluorescent bursts to cross from one crystalline material to another.",
      "B) Polarons allow for the dipoles to synchronize despite higher temperatures.",

      "D) Polarons decrease the intensity of the superfluorescent burst."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes Biliroglu and colleagues\u2019 claim about how the polarons function in relation to superfluorescence. The text indicates that \u201cuntil recently,\u201d superfluorescence (intense, synchronized bursts of light emitted by dipoles) has solely been observed at very cold temperatures. However, it also states that, recently, Biliroglu and colleagues report observing the phenomenon at room temperature. They achieved this using \u201cthin films made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials,\u201d which the researchers claim allows for the formation of polarons. They also suggest that these polarons might absorb the thermal shocks that typically disrupt dipole synchronization at warmer temperatures. Thus, based on the text, Biliroglu and colleagues believe that polarons help dipoles synchronize at temperatures well above those at which superfluorescence had previously been observed. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address the prospect of a superfluorescent burst moving between crystalline materials or any other mediums. Choice C is incorrect because the text\u2019s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. Rather than suggesting that polarons speed up superfluorescent bursts, the text suggests that no superfluorescence can occur at room temperature in the absence of polarons. Thus, the text indicates that polarons make superfluorescent bursts more likely to occur at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed, not that polarons accelerate the bursts. Choice D is incorrect because the text\u2019s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. In the absence of polarons, the text suggests there would be no superfluorescence at room temperature. Thus, rather than decrease the intensity of superfluorescent bursts, polarons make them more likely to occur under certain circumstances.",

Choice A is incorrect because Dorian isn\u2019t depicted as interested in Hallward\u2019s opinion of the portrait but rather as so enraptured by the painting that he\u2019s hardly even aware of Hallward.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the portrait of Dorian is the only painting that is mentioned in the text, so there\u2019s no evidence that Dorian prefers portraits to other types of paintings. Although Dorian is depicted as delighted with this particular portrait, there\u2019s no way of knowing from the text whether he likes portraits better than other kinds of paintings. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Dorian is uncertain about Hallward\u2019s talent. Instead, the text is focused on Dorian\u2019s delight with the portrait.",

    "question": "According to the text, why would a helicopter built for Earth be unable to fly on Mars?",
    "passage": "In 2014, Amelia Quon and her team at NASA set out to build a helicopter capable of flying on Mars. Because Mars\u2019s atmosphere is only one percent as dense as Earth\u2019s, the air of Mars would not provide enough resistance to the rotating blades of a standard helicopter for the aircraft to stay aloft. For five years, Quon\u2019s team tested designs in a lab that mimicked Mars\u2019s atmospheric conditions. The craft the team ultimately designed can fly on Mars because its blades are longer and rotate faster than those of a helicopter of the same size built for Earth.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Because Mars and Earth have different atmospheric conditions",
      "B) Because the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars",

      "D) Because helicopters built for Earth are too small to handle the conditions on Mars"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation about a helicopter that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Mars\u2019s atmosphere is much less dense than Earth\u2019s, and as a result, the air on Mars doesn\u2019t provide the resistance required to support the blades of a helicopter built for Earth and to keep the helicopter aloft. In other words, a helicopter built for Earth can\u2019t fly on Mars because of the differences in the two planets\u2019 atmospheres. Choice B is incorrect because instead of stating that the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars, the text indicates that the helicopter built to fly on Mars actually has even longer blades than a helicopter built for Earth. Choice C is incorrect because the text never addresses the role of gravity on Mars or on Earth; instead, it focuses on atmospheric conditions. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that helicopters built for Earth are too small to operate in the conditions on Mars. In fact, the text states that the size of the helicopter built to fly on Mars is the same size as a helicopter built for Earth, even though it has longer blades that rotate faster.",

The text indicates that dog owners typically claim that some dog breeds are \u201cmore likely than others to have particular personality traits.\u201d In other words, the text points out that a commonly held belief about dog breeds is that their personality traits are heritable. The text then states that Kathleen Morrill and colleagues undertook research about dog trait heritability and found that \u201cbehavior varies widely among dogs of the same breed.\u201d Because Morrill and colleagues found evidence for variability rather than consistency in the behavior of dogs of the same breed, the statement that research fails to uphold a commonly held belief about dog breeds and behavior accurately reflects the main idea of the text.

Although the text mentions that humans have long intervened in dogs\u2019 reproduction by intentionally crossbreeding certain dogs, it doesn\u2019t argue that such intervention is essential to the existence of dog breeds.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss the popularity of any dog breeds; breeds are mentioned as having certain traits, but the text says nothing about the popularity of these breeds or traits. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text briefly mentions that Morrill and colleagues conducted a study about dog traits using both surveys and DNA sequencing, this is not the main focus of the text.

The text explains that up until Wang and his team\u2019s discovery, the only fossil evidence of mixopterids came from the paleocontinent of Laurussia. Wang and his team, however, identified fossil remains of a mixopterid species from the paleocontinent Gondwana. Therefore, the team\u2019s discovery was significant because the fossil remains of a mixopterid species were outside of the paleocontinent Laurussia. Choice A is incorrect.

The text begins by stating that Mar\u00eda Izquierdo was an important figure in the history of twentieth-century Mexican art, but despite her importance, her work hasn\u2019t received widespread recognition in the United States. According to the text, one reason for this is that Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera are so famous in the US that they overshadow other important Mexican artists, including Izquierdo. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Izquierdo\u2019s work is less well known in the US than it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw most of the public\u2019s attention.

All but one of the 20 moons are thought to be remnants of bodies that orbited Saturn until they broke apart in collisions.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the moon with the eccentric orbit. The text indicates that three of the 20 newly discovered moons have prograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, while the other 17 moons have retrograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the opposite direction of the planet\u2019s spin. The text then states that 19 of the 20 moons appear to be the remains of earlier bodies that orbited Saturn but were broken apart in collisions. The one exception is a moon that orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, meaning that the exceptional moon\u2019s orbit is prograde. The text goes on to state that the exceptional moon\u2019s orbit is so eccentric that the moon may have formed through a different process than the other 19 moons. The moon with the eccentric orbit, therefore, has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text supports the idea that the moon with the eccentric orbit likely has the same origin as the moons with retrograde orbits. Although it\u2019s true that the moon has a prograde orbit (and thus doesn\u2019t have a retrograde orbit), the only information the text provides about the moon\u2019s origin is that it may be different than the origin of the other 19 moons. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the moon in question orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, meaning that the moon\u2019s orbit is prograde, not that its orbit is neither prograde nor retrograde.

And although he does imply a sense of isolation, it is isolation from those on the ground, as when he says of himself and his companions, \"We are now alone.\" Choice C is incorrect because the narrator doesn\u2019t suggest that he or his companions are troubled by the effects of the balloon ride. Instead, he describes himself and his companions as \"joyous\" and the experience of floating in the balloon as \"delicious.\" Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator is surprised by his companions\u2019 response to the balloon ride. In fact, the text indicates that the narrator and his companions are having the same experience: they\u2019re described as \"silent\" and \"motionless,\" rather than as having unrestrained enthusiasm.",

    "passage": "The recovery of a 1,000-year-old Chinese shipwreck in the Java Sea near present-day Indonesia has yielded a treasure trove of artifacts, including thousands of small ceramic bowls. Using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool, Lisa Niziolek and her team were able to detect the chemical composition of these bowls without damaging them. By comparing the chemical signatures of the bowls with those of the materials still at old Chinese kiln sites, Niziolek and her team can pinpoint which Chinese kilns likely produced the ceramic bowls.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Because of a new technology, researchers can locate and recover more shipwrecks than they could in the past.",
      "B) Researchers have been able to identify the location of a number of Chinese kilns in operation 1,000 years ago.",
      "C) With the help of a special tool, researchers have determined the likely origin of bowls recovered from a shipwreck.",
      "D) Before the invention of portable X-ray fluorescence, researchers needed to take a small piece out of an artifact to analyze its components."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, thousands of ceramic bowls were found in a recovered Chinese shipwreck. The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls\u2019 chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had produced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls\u2019 origin. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the researchers used technology in the form of a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, it doesn\u2019t specifically state that this technology is new. In addition, the text says that Niziolek and her team used the tool to determine the chemical composition of bowls that were found in a Chinese shipwreck, not to locate and recover the shipwreck itself. There\u2019s no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers collected materials from old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the ceramic bowls, which means that the researchers must have already known the location of those kiln sites. Rather than identifying the location of the kilns, the researchers determined which kilns in operation 1,000 years ago had likely produced the bowls that were found in the shipwreck.\n\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although the text says that using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool enabled Niziolek and her team to analyze artifacts in the form of ceramic bowls without damaging them, the text doesn\u2019t discuss how researchers analyzed artifacts before this tool was invented. Moreover, the point that the bowls were left undamaged isn\u2019t the text\u2019s main idea. Rather, it\u2019s a detail that\u2019s provided to develop the main idea, which is that the researchers used a special tool to determine where the bowls had been produced.",

The text then goes on to contrast this position with that of historians, who \"see things differently\": according to these historians, the pachuca style showed a wish for freedom and self-expression, and it acted as a kind of rebellion against what society expected of women at the time. Therefore, according to the text, historians think that the pachuca style was a way for Mexican women to express themselves and resist strict social expectations. Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly describes the pachuca style as a distinctive look adopted during the World War II era. It does not indicate that the pachuca style influences fashion in the United States in the present day. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not indicate that Mexican American women wore the pachuca style to show support for the United States during World War II; rather, the style was a means of self-expression and rebellion against social expectations. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not compare the pachuca style to other fashion trends: the pachuca style is the only style mentioned.",

    "question": "It can most reasonably be inferred from the text that the finding about the microorganism community composition was important for which reason?",
    "passage": "To understand how temperature change affects microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients in alpine ecosystems, Eva Ka\u0161tovsk\u00e1 et al. collected plant-soil cores in the Tatra Mountains at elevations around 2,100 meters and transplanted them to elevations of 1,700\u20131,800 meters, where the mean air temperature was warmer by 2\u00b0C. Microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores; crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged, allowing Ka\u0161tovsk\u00e1 et al. to attribute the acceleration to temperature-induced increases in microorganism activity.",
    "choices": [
      "A) It provided preliminary evidence that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores.",
      "B) It suggested that temperature-induced changes in microorganism activity may be occurring at increasingly high elevations.",
      "C) It ruled out a potential alternative explanation for the acceleration in microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling.",
      "D) It clarified that microorganism activity levels in the plant-soil cores varied depending on which microorganisms comprised the community."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes why the finding about the microorganism community composition was important. The text describes an experiment by Eva Ka\u0161tovsk\u00e1 and her team in which they collected plant-soil cores at one elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer. Ka\u0161tovsk\u00e1 and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that \"crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged,\" which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn\u2019t have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted cores, this is unrelated to what\u2019s important about the finding that the microorganism composition didn\u2019t change\u2014that it allowed the team to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text compares activity in one core at two different elevations, the text doesn\u2019t address changes in activity at various elevations over time. Choice D is incorrect. Although different microorganisms likely exhibit different levels of activity, the text indicates that there was no change in microorganism composition, and there is nothing in the text about different microorganisms having different activity levels.",

      "D) Narratives that are told out of chronological order are more difficult for audiences to understand than are narratives presented chronologically."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by explaining that many literary theorists rely on the concepts of fabula (a narrative\u2019s content) and syuzhet (a narrative\u2019s arrangement and presentation of events) and illustrates these concepts by explaining how they can be applied to the film The Godfather Part II. The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that fabula and syuzhet can\u2019t fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning. Thus, the main idea is that Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives. Choice B is incorrect because according to the text, Mikhail Bakhtin believed that meaning was created through the interactions of the artist, narrative, and audience, not simply through the interaction between the audience and narrative; moreover, the text doesn\u2019t address whether Bakhtin focused on the ways in which different people interpret narratives differently. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that the storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II are complicated, it discusses the film only to illustrate how the concepts of fabula and syuzhet may be applied to a narrative. The film\u2019s storytelling methods aren\u2019t the primary focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses The Godfather Part II, whose narrative doesn\u2019t adhere to a single chronological order, only to illustrate the concepts of fabula (a narrative\u2019s content) and syuzhet (a narrative\u2019s arrangement and presentation of events). The primary focus of this text isn\u2019t the structure of this film or of other narratives that are told out of chronological order; moreover, the text doesn\u2019t consider whether such structures make it harder for audiences to understand narratives.",

It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that if New hadn\u2019t reduced the time it took to make each bag by starting to use sewing machines, it would have been hard for him to keep up with the increased demand. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that New added unique, handcrafted details to his bags before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that individually designing each bag would have been a consequence of not using sewing machines, since New was already designing unique details for each bag before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that people were already interested in New\u2019s bags before he started using sewing machines.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid. Choice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself.",

      "D) As is the case for other dogs, Karenin\u2019s sense of time seems to accelerate depending on the objects and places that surround him."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that Tomas and Tereza\u2019s dog Karenin felt disrupted by a recent move because of his dislike of change. The text then goes on to suggest that this is because the way a dog experiences time differs from the way humans experience time: time for a dog doesn\u2019t move linearly, going \"on and on, from one thing to the next,\" but instead moves circularly, \"like the hands of a clock.\" That is, time for a dog is experienced as a cyclical pattern characterized by routine and predictability, with each day \"following the same path.\" The text then concludes by providing examples of seemingly insignificant changes in routine that profoundly \"disturbed [Karenin\u2019s] sense of time,\" causing him to feel displeasure. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Karenin\u2019s sense of time as a dog involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes Karenin\u2019s displeasure with the recent move to a new home, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the move has made his negative responses more pronounced than they once were. Rather, in accounting for Karenin\u2019s displeasure with the move to Switzerland, the text explains that Karenin generally has a negative response to any kind of change. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Karenin comprehends time similarly to how Tomas and Tereza comprehend it. On the contrary, the text strongly implies a contrast between dogs\u2019 circular experience of time with the way humans experience time as a straightforward progression that can be \"plotted on a straight line.\" Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no indication that a change in the places and objects surrounding Karenin causes him to feel as though time is accelerating. Although the text does use the language of \"dash[ing] madly ahead\" in relation to time, the phrase appears in the context of a comparison illustrating how dogs experience time: time for a dog moves just as the hands of a clock do, in a circle and \"unwilling to dash madly ahead\"\u2014that is, always in a regular and predictable way.",

    "passage": "Since its completion in 2014, Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest)\u2014a pair of residential towers in Milan, Italy, covered by vegetation\u2014has become a striking symbol of environmental sustainability in architecture. Stefano Boeri intended his design, which features balconies that are home to hundreds of trees, to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity.

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about critics\u2019 skepticism of Bosco Verticale that is supported by the text. The text states that Boeri\u2019s design for Bosco Verticale features hundreds of trees on balconies and is intended to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. But the text goes on to state that some critics believe that it is too early to determine if the trees planted on Bosco Verticale can thrive there. Therefore, according to the text, critics are skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale because it is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri\u2019s goals was for Bosco Verticale to serve as a model for promoting biodiversity in architecture, which suggests that Boeri would likely support the idea of reproducing the same concept in other locations, the text does not discuss whether it is feasible to adapt the design to locations other than Milan. Instead, the text describes critics\u2019 concerns that the plant life that currently exists on Bosco Verticale might not thrive in its current setting. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri\u2019s goals in creating Bosco Verticale was to promote biodiversity, which implies a goal of including varied plant life in the design, it does not mention whether the hundreds of trees that were planted on its balconies failed to meet this goal. Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale\u2019s balconies may not thrive in this setting. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not mention how Bosco Verticale was constructed, let alone how environmentally destructive its construction may have been relative to the construction of more conventional buildings.",

    "passage": "A subject of much speculation, distinctive sets of parallel ridges mark the icy crust of Europa, Jupiter\u2019s smallest moon. Researchers now claim that the ridges\u2019 formation mechanism mirrors that of a strikingly similar pair on Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. There, surface water seeped through fissures in the sheet and formed a water pocket that subsequently disrupted the overlying ice, forcing fragments of it upward and outward into peaks, as the pocket froze and expanded. Although Europa lacks liquid surface water, the same process could be driven by the moon\u2019s subsurface ocean.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. The text focuses on formations of parallel ice ridges on Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa that are said to be formed by the same mechanism that formed a parallel set of ridges on Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. The text indicates that in Greenland, water on the surface seeps to the lower portion of the ice sheet, resulting in uplift that creates the ridges, and it states that although Europa lacks liquid water on its surface, the same process could be driven by an ocean below Europa\u2019s surface. In other words, the main idea of the text is that parallel ridges in the ice on Europa and Greenland are likely caused by similar processes even though in Greenland the process begins with liquid water on the surface while Europa lacks liquid water on the surface. Choice B is incorrect because the text states outright that the ridges on Europa are parallel and furthermore refers to Greenland\u2019s ridges as \"strikingly similar\" to those on Europa. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of when any of the ice ridges formed, either separately or relative to one another. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not indicate any uncertainty about the reason for the ice ridges on Europa and, in fact, clearly states that researchers now claim to know the mechanism that created the ridges.",

The text indicates that a team of astronomers mapped the magnetic field of G47, a galactic bone in the Milky Way, and that the mapping \"surprisingly\" revealed \"no clear pattern or direction\" in the magnetic field. The text then adds that the researchers had thought the magnetic field would be as uniform as the magnetic fields of other galactic bones in the Milky Way are.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it states a conclusion the researchers likely agree with, given the details in the text. The text explains that a biosignature gas is a gas that can be used as an indicator that a planet harbors some form of life and some astronomers have proposed that NH3 could serve as a biosignature gas. The researchers evaluating this claim found that the atmosphere of rocky planets would be unlikely to reach \"detectably high levels\" of NH3 without biological activity, which would support the proposal of NH3 serving as a biosignature gas. However, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can produce NH3 in the absence of biological activity. Thus, the text is structured to lead to the conclusion that detectable levels of NH3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets could constitute a biosignature, but that is not the case for detectable levels of the gas in the atmospheres of mini-Neptune planets. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that biological activity likely accounts for detectable levels of NH3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets but mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of NH3 in their atmospheres in the absence of biological activity. Therefore, both rocky planets and mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of atmospheric NH3. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that for NH3 to reach detectable levels in the atmospheres of rocky planets likely means they harbor biological activity, meaning that rocky planets with detectable NH3 usually harbor biological activity. However, that does not entail that every rocky planet with biological activity will have detectable levels of NH3 in their atmospheres. Choice D is incorrect because the text claims only that some astronomers have proposed using NH3 as a biosignature gas without mentioning a minimum concentration of atmospheric NH3 that must be met for it to function as a biosignature gas.",

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss how often Paleolithic cave artists used each kind of light source tested. Although the text does compare animal-fat lamps with another lighting method, the point of that comparison is that animal-fat lamps were less useful than torches when walking, not that one method was used more often than another. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss either how difficult it was for Medina-Alcaide and her team to replicate light sources or how the team felt about drawing conclusions from their study. Instead, the text reveals that the team was able to conclude that each light source likely had a distinct purpose.",

    "passage": "Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic waste. Areas of the ocean with higher concentrations of microplastic particles also have smaller and fewer waves. A study by Yukun Sun and colleagues found that the concentration of microplastic particles cannot be the only reason for this reduced wave activity because the concentration of particles that would have the observed effect is much higher than that found in these areas of the ocean. However, they found that surfactants, chemicals often used to manufacture plastics, are released into the water from microplastics and have a much stronger wave-reducing effect.",

      "A) They have a much stronger effect on wave activity than microplastics alone do.",

      "D) They can be used to contain microplastics within certain areas of the ocean."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about surfactants that is supported by the text. The text indicates that higher concentrations of microplastics have been associated with waves that are relatively small and few. According to the text, however, a study by Sun and colleagues found that concentrations of microplastic particles can\u2019t be the only reason for the reduced wave activity because a much higher concentration of particles is needed to produce that observed effect. Instead, the text indicates that Sun and colleagues found that surfactants are released from microplastics into the ocean and have a much stronger wave-reducing effect than microplastics alone do. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss what surfactants are made of. Instead, it indicates that surfactants are frequently used to manufacture microplastics and that Sun and colleagues discovered that surfactants are released from microplastics into the ocean. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss how microplastics can be removed from the ocean. Instead, the text indicates that Sun and colleagues discovered that surfactants are released into the ocean from microplastics and have a much stronger wave-reducing effect than microplastics alone do. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that surfactants can be used to contain microplastics within certain areas of the ocean.

    "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    "passage": "Artificial leaves are a developing renewable energy technology that mimics the process of photosynthesis in plants. These devices are silicon-based solar cells coated in chemical catalysts that activate reactions that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gas. The technology, while generating lots of interest, is not yet commercially viable as a large-scale energy source. To meet this challenge, scientists from many fields are researching ways to store, transport, and distribute the energy the devices produce while other scientists are working to improve the cost and efficiency of the devices.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Continued research and development in artificial-leaf technology is needed before the devices can be widely used as an energy source.",
      "B) The recent increase in the commercial use of artificial leaves as an energy source has encouraged many scientists to research ways to improve the technology.",
      "C) Artificial leaves split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas using catalysts more efficiently than plants do using the process of photosynthesis.",
      "D) Artificial leaves were developed to mimic the natural process of photosynthesis in plants in order to store energy for long-term commercial use."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, artificial leaves are a renewable energy technology that\u2019s in development and generating interest. The text goes on to state that artificial-leaf technology \"is not yet commercially viable as a large-scale energy source\" and that scientists from several fields are doing additional research to refine the technology. Thus, the main idea is that continued research and development in artificial-leaf technology is needed before the devices can be widely used as an energy source. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that scientists from many fields are researching artificial leaves, they\u2019re doing so to address the fact that the leaves are not yet commercially viable, rather than in response to an increase in commercial use. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does explain that artificial leaves help split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas using catalysts, it doesn\u2019t argue that this process is more efficient than photosynthesis. This is merely a detail of the text and not the main idea, which is about the additional research needed to improve the cost and efficiency of these artificial leaves. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that artificial leaves mimic photosynthesis in plants, this is an incidental detail in support of the main idea that additional research is needed to make artificial leaves commercially viable.",

    "question": "According to the text, what was surprising to scientists studying the seismic activity data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander?",
    "passage": "Recently, scientists looked at data collected by NASA\u2019s InSight lander to learn more about seismic activity on Mars, known as marsquakes. The data show that the marsquakes all started from the same location on the planet. This discovery was surprising to scientists, as they expected that the marsquakes would originate from all over the planet because of the cooling of the planet\u2019s surface. Now, scientists believe that there could be areas of active magma flows deep beneath the planet\u2019s surface that trigger the marsquakes.",
    "choices": [
      "A) The surface temperature of Mars has been rising.",
      "B) There were different types of seismic waves causing marsquakes.",
      "C) NASA\u2019s InSight lander collected less data than scientists had expected.",
      "D) All the marsquakes started from the same location on the planet."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about what surprised the scientists that is supported by the text. The text states that the marsquakes described in the data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander originated from the same location on Mars. The text goes on to say that because they had expected the opposite (that marsquakes would originate from all over the planet) this discovery surprised the scientists. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t say that the data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander revealed any surprising information about the planet\u2019s surface temperature. Instead, the text mentions the cooling of Mars\u2019s surface as a reason the scientists expected that marsquakes had multiple origins. In addition, cooling would indicate that the temperature has been falling rather than rising. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that by studying seismic activity scientists found a possible explanation for what causes marsquakes, the text doesn\u2019t say that they discovered that marsquakes are caused by different types of seismic waves. Rather, the text states that based on the data from NASA\u2019s InSight lander, scientists now believe that this seismic activity happens because of areas of active magma that flow below the planet\u2019s surface. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss the amount of data NASA\u2019s InSight lander collected or whether scientists who studied the data found the amount to be as expected. Instead, the text focuses on what the data revealed about where on Mars the marsquakes originated.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a description of how Zerviah Holme felt that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Holme \"did not like to be interrupted\" while reading Gibbon and that he considered interruptions to be \"an insult.\" Furthermore, the text suggests that Gibbon is Holme\u2019s favorite author because, as the text states, \"he was always reading Gibbon.\" Thus, Holme would have felt annoyed at having been interrupted when the letter was delivered. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Holme is relieved to receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme \"just glanced indifferently at the letter,\" suggesting that the letter wasn\u2019t important to him. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that Holme is excited to receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme didn\u2019t put down his book to receive the letter and that he looked at the letter \"indifferently\" and at the postman \"impatiently.\" This suggests that Holme isn\u2019t excited. Also, there is no mention that Holme knows who sent the letter. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Holme is sad or that he wants to speak with the postman.

    "passage": "In her 1998 book*Blues Legacies and Black Feminism*, Angela Y. Davis bases her analysis in part on recordings of songs sung in the 1920s by Gertrude \u201cMa\u201d Rainey and Bessie Smith. Davis focuses on how Rainey and Smith improvised the lyrics\u2014replacing the original lines with mischievous jokes and wordplay. Davis\u2019s work was particularly labor intensive because in order to transcribe, or write down, the lyrics as Rainey and Smith sang them, Davis had to listen repeatedly to the vinyl recordings, which weren\u2019t very clear.",
    "choices": [
      "A) The songs have grown in popularity since Rainey and Smith first sang them.",
      "B) There were more recordings made of Rainey\u2019s songs than there were of Smith\u2019s.",

      "D) According to Davis, the songs sung by Rainey were more musically innovative than those sung by Smith typically were."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it describes the songs sung by Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey and Bessie Smith in a way the text implies is accurate. The text describes Angela Y. Davis\u2019s research on Rainey and Smith for her book Blues Legacies and Black Feminism, focusing on her efforts to transcribe the improvised lyrics in Rainey\u2019s and Smith\u2019s songs. The text calls Davis\u2019s transcription process \"labor intensive\" since the lack of clarity in the recordings required her to listen to each repeatedly to verify the accuracy of her transcripts. The fact that Davis undertook a painstaking transcription process using only fairly low-fidelity recordings suggests that reliable transcriptions were otherwise unavailable to her. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn\u2019t discuss the popularity of Rainey\u2019s and Smith\u2019s songs either in the 1920s or after. Although it is plausible that the music of Rainey and Smith is more widely enjoyed than it was in the 1920s, this isn\u2019t supported by the text. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn\u2019t discuss which of Rainey and Smith was the more prolific recording artist and so provides no support for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the creativity of both Rainey and Smith, but it does so only to note similarities between them in terms of improvisation and wit, not to emphasize differences between them or Davis\u2019s relative views of the artists\u2019 inventiveness.",
