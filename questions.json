    "choices": ["A) to join", "B) is joining", "C) joined", "D) joins"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of nonfinite verb forms in a sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive verb \"to join\" is correctly used to form a subordinate clause that expresses why Ochoa left her position (to join the training program). Choice B is incorrect because the finite verb \"is joining\" can’t be used in this way to indicate Ochoa’s action of joining the training program. A conjunction such as \"and\" would be needed to coordinate \"is joining\" with the previous finite verb, \"left.\" Choice C is incorrect because the finite verb \"joined\" can’t be used in this way to indicate Ochoa’s action of joining the training program. A conjunction such as \"and\" would be needed to coordinate \"joined\" with the previous finite verb, \"left.\" Choice D is incorrect because the finite verb \"joins\" can’t be used in this way to indicate Ochoa’s action of joining the training program. A conjunction such as \"and\" would be needed to coordinate \"joins\" with the previous finite verb, \"left.\"",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. Faure redesigned the battery in 1881, and the original battery was invented “fifteen years earlier.” Notice that this is the only choice in the past tense. To indicate that a past occurrence took place before another past occurrence, we need to use “had” + the past tense form of the verb. This is called the “past perfect” tense. Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a tense error. Planté invented the original battery in the past, so we shouldn’t use the present tense “is inventing.” Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a tense error. Planté invented the original battery in the past, so we shouldn’t use the future tense “will invent.” Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a tense error. Planté invented the original battery in the past, so we shouldn’t use the present tense “invents.”",

    "passage": "After winning the 1860 presidential election, Abraham Lincoln appointed Edward Bates, Salmon P. Chase, and William H. Seward to his cabinet.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. The subject of the verb is “Lincoln,” and the first sentence tells us that we’re talking about something that Abraham Lincoln did in 1860. So the simple past tense “leveraged” fits the logic of the text. Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. “Has leveraged” is the present perfect tense, which is used for an action that began in the past and continues into the present. Lincoln started leveraging his rivals’ talents in 1860—it’s definitely not still happening today. So the present perfect tense isn’t appropriate. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. “Is leveraging” is the present tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals’ talents in 1860, so the present tense isn’t appropriate. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. “Will leverage” is the future tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals’ talents in 1860, so the future tense isn’t appropriate.",
